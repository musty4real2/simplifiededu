The indications are all there once you have the eyes to see them. Have you fell into the "I think Iâ€™m too smart for my own good" trap? Hello!!! DonÂ´t worry the big part of correcting a mistake is realizing it exists! Check out these 5 signs you are not as smart as you think you are and see if any or all apply to you. Coming quickly to terms with them and correcting this kind of self-defeating behavior can make you truly smarter fast! And perhaps more importantly, much happier too.<p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<br/><p><b>Lack of Professional Success</b></p><br/>\r\n<p><b>Opinions are by their nature subjective</b> â€“ think of beauty as being in the eyes of the beholder as a classic example â€“ while end results, like numbers in a pay check are very much objective and impossible to argue with. Smart people leverage their intelligence into professional success. If you are thirty five years old, consider yourself brilliant yet are living at your parentâ€™s apartment itÂ´s pretty clear you are not as smart as you think you are. Smart people figure out a way to make money not make excuses!</p><br/>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<br/><p><b>Always Being in the Center of Conflict.</b></p><br/>\r\n<p><b>Smart people, truly smart people that is, donÂ´t spend every waking moment wasted in argument, conflict and debate.</b> The need to prove how correct you are at the expense of co-workers, friends, family and the majority of people you meet on the street reveals an insecurity that truly intelligent people rarely have. ItÂ´s a flashing neon sign that tells the world you are not nearly as smart as you think you are! Avoid unneeded conflict and watch the energy you save get utilized for positive projects and to fuel constructive behavior. Now thatÂ´s a sign you are getting smarter!</p><br/>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<br/><b><p> You Are Always Rushing Around and Way too Busy</b></p><br/>\r\n<p>Do you find most of your days fighting the clock and running from crisis to crisis? Time and energy management is a skill all truly smart people quickly learn to manage to make the most out of life, minimize stress and out produce their less smart peers. Ask yourself if you are so intelligent why are you always running around in a panic like a chicken without a head? Occasional bouts of overwork may be unavoidable aspects of our professional or home lives, certainly, but if this is a reoccurring nightmare you are hardly as smart as you may like to think you are. Smart people know this is hardly a way to live or to produce up to a personÂ´s true highest potential!<p><br/>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<br/><b><p>You Talk Much More than You Listen</p></b><br/>\r\n<p>What do you think of when you are around someone who just wonÂ´t stop talking to even catch a breath? DonÂ´t images of scam artists, unscrupulous used car salesmen and high school air heads flash to mind? Certainly not people with true intelligence who understand thereÂ´s much more benefit and lasting power in the sometimes lost art of listening rather than talking. Which category do you most often fall it â€“ the endless babbler or the active listener? The answer says a great deal about just how smart you really are. Listen more and talk less.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<br/><b><p>Your Reading Habits are Hardly Challenging</p></b><br/>\r\n<p>If you needed to find one top quality shared by all truly intelligent people you could do much worse than focusing on the love of reading. Real reading about difficult and thought provoking subjects â€“ not escapist low brow entertainment. Reading is an essential tool in the quest for continued self development and itÂ´s embraced by all the truly smart. If you consider yourself in this category, but spend your free time zoned out in front of the television or wasting time reading foolish crime novels it may be time to reconsider. A few hours of challenging reading a night can help expand your intelligence and creativity in astoundingly magical ways and move you quickly towards being smart for real. Adopting this habit alone can be a true game changer you will have no choice, but to thank yourself for a year from now. DonÂ´t hesitate to act on it if youâ€™d like to be smart rather than just think you are smart!</p><br/>\r\n<p>Ooooooooops you just discovered you are not that smart right? So its either you burst the idea of being smart or act like a smart one and mend your ways.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n', 1),
(2, 'These judgments may not seem politically correct or even fair, but they happen. They are as much a part of the interview process as much as handing in your resume. When you hand them that resume, you are giving them the right judge, analyze and evaluate you and your lifeâ€™s accomplishments. They want to see if you will fit the position they have available.

They make that decision by judging you. They look at your mannerisms, personality, style and much more.</p>\r\n<p>Whether these judgments are made subconsciously or on purpose, they are there and they do happen. You should be aware of these things before going into an interview. Do your best to prepare yourself so you can present the kind of person they want to hire.</p>\r\n<p>These truths may seem harsh, but itâ€™s reality. You should be aware of all these things before going in to an interview. Just remember, itâ€™s not just your resume theyâ€™re looking at.</p>\r\n<ol>Here are 7 harsh truths about getting hired.<o/l>\r\n<li> Whatâ€™s in a Name?</li>\r\nThe first thing your interviewer will see on your resume is your name. You want it to make a good impression. Think about the name you have at the top of the paper before sending it in.<br/>\r\nSome nicknames are looked at as immature and childish. Letâ€™s look at this from the interviewers perspective: you have two applicants trying to get the same position. You look at their resume and they are fairly similar. You look at their names, one is named Michael and the other, AJ. Judging by names alone, which one sounds more professional? And be honest! Of course Michael does. Nicknames are fine for friends and family members, even for coworkers once you have the job, but wait until you get the job before introducing yourself, â€œHi! My friends call me Bubba.â€<br/>\r\nUnfortunately people will also judge you by the ethnic origin of your name. Names that are commonly associated with a specific race will be judged according to the interviewersâ€™ general perception of that group of people.<br/>\r\nItâ€™s not about changing who you are; itâ€™s about being strategic and getting yourself in the running so you have a chance at getting the job.<br/>\r\n <li>Hey Good Lookinâ€™!</li>\r\nLooks matter. Good looking people are more likely to get hired than unattractive people. They get more callbacks and more job offers. Many attractive people have lived their life receiving compliments, praise, etc. this has resulted in having high self-esteem and confidence in themselves. People look for those qualities when hiring someone to work for them.\r\n<li> The Short End of the Stick.</li>\r\nShort people are less likely to be in higher paid or more reputable positions. People who hold prestigious positions usually have a very dominant personality. They are seen as confident, powerful and bold. Short people are rarely described with these words.\r\n<li>Age does matter.</li>\r\nYou can be either too old or too young in their eyes. If youâ€™re young they assume you donâ€™t have any experience, in a career position or within the field itself. If you are considered to be too old, it might make them wonder why you are searching for a job at this point in your life. Why couldnâ€™t you commit at your previous job?\r\n<li> You posted that on Facebook?</li>\r\nSocial media accounts will be checked. We live in a technology based world. The things you post on your social media profiles are a reflection of who you are. Your posts will show your interests, vocabulary, maturity level, etc. These are all things a perspective boss will look into. They want to know the kind of person they are hiring and social media has made that easier than filing for a background check.\r\n<li> Your dog ate your resume?</li>\r\nComing unprepared to an interview is one the worst things you could do. It forces the interviewer to make snap judgments about you that may or may not be true. They will assume you are lazy, irresponsible, you canâ€™t prioritize, you procrastinate and much more. These are not thoughts you want running through an interviewersâ€™ mind as youâ€™re sitting in the chair across from them.\r\n<li> Zip code profiling.</li>\r\nPeople are aware of which zip codes represent what kind of community. Interviewers will judge you based on where you live. There are few things you can do if this situation is a possibility for you. Most people have stopped putting their address on resumes. A phone number and email address should suffice. Others will put a parent or family memberâ€™s address, if they live in a good community.<br/>\r\n \r\nSearching for a job is hard enough. So many things factor into whether or not you get the job. Itâ€™s not only about your qualifications. Some of these factors are things that you might never have thought about, but they matter. There are items in this list that might be harsh, but itâ€™s the reality of the job search world.<br/>\r\nThese are mistakes you could be making and not know. Sometimes the smallest thing could cause you not to get hired. Take these truths into consideration the next time you go in for an interview.<br/>\r\nIf you fall into one of these categories, we arenâ€™t saying you donâ€™tâ€™ have a chance. Weâ€™re saying go in, be prepared and be the one to break the mold.<br/>\r\n<i>Source: http://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/7-harsh-truths-you-need-learn-about-getting-hired.html</i>\r\n', 0),

Help yourself improve by following this simple steps', '<h2>10 Tips to help you become a better student.</h2>', '<p>As a student you want to stand out among your peers or you wonder why its so easy for that girl in your class to make such good grades. Help yourself improve by following this simple steps:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>Do your homework.</b></li> If you have homework due on Monday that was given on Friday, don''t start the assignment on Saturday evening or on Sunday monday. Take your homework seriously and try hard problems, even if you''re not sure on them. If you are really having trouble, ask a friend or a parent. Don''t stress about your homework though. Don''t let yourself go over 40 minutes a night per assignment, don''t procrastinate either. Manage your time.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Study definitions and complete some exercises.</b></li> If you have a big test or essay coming up, don''t spend your time on watching television. Tests are a huge part of your final grade. Spend every free moment looking at the textbook, studying. When you have more free time, do some extra exercises; give yourself extra challenges. Make flashcards of words and remember to feel completely prepared when you come into class each day. A good sign is if you know all the questions, you''re prepared.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Take notes in class and make sure they are neat, so you can read them later on.</b></li> Notes are judged upon in some schools, and if yours is, watch out. Write your name and date at the top of each. Use a nice, sharp, and practice neat handwriting. Write what the teacher writes on the board and what the teacher says is important. Avoid chit chattering with friends when the teacher is in the class. And if it happens that you have to be away, ensure you have the contact information of two or three reliable classmates of yours.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Read Ahead: Look over the next chapters in your textbooks and scan over it. </b></li>This way, the next day you will understand more when your teacher explains. Don''t really read them, just scan them over, and see what you''ll be learning next unless that teacher does not want you to.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Pay attention during class.</b></li> If you don''t pay attention it will be almost impossible for you to understand the lesson by yourself. Remember to participate in class as well. This is good for your relationship with your teacher, for your grades. Never think of your teacher as your enemy rather think of them as your allies.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Ask to seek clarification.</b></li> If you are confused on something in class, ask the teacher. Teachers love questions, but not too many. Remember not to bug her all the time with endless questions. When asking them, be polite, simple, and get to the point. Only ask what you''re confused on though, because teachers can tell whether or not you are confused. And while studying out of class, be sure to walk up to that brilliant kid in your class.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Presentation matters.</b></li> its not just about getting your assignments done, also ensure your work is neat and include diagrams where necessary and if possible type it. Ensure also not to over do it.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Don''t look at the clock at all during the class. </b></li>It''s disrespectful to the teacher, and if you keep looking, it''s going to seem like a longer class. Bring a watch if you need to, to sneak a look.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Create a study group.</b></li>Two heads are always better than one. Pick out two or three people with different personalities from yours and create a study group to meet once a week to discuss the subject matter covered in class. This is a great way to stimulate intellectual thought, challenge perspectives, and share information.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Get/Stay Organized.</b></li> Try as much as possible to be organized. Be up to date at school. Know when your tests and quizzes come up. Have a planner to help you simplify getting tasks done\r\n', 0),

There are over a billion-and-one people struggling to show the world what they have to offer. No one knows what you have until you show it to them, but whose got the time to sample you?. Social medias like facebook, twitter, linked in, blogs, etc has made everybody known. What singles you out is how you present yourself, which brings us to â€œ The <b>YOU</b> Brandâ€.</p>\r\n<p>The first step to branding yourself is to â€œknow your brandâ€. Whatâ€™s your Brand? Your brand is a collection of your interests, skills, talents, values, beliefs, goals, principles and much more. Your brand is an expression of who you are. Once you know your personal brand, then you can go ahead and create your brand. Without a proper definition of your personal brand, you canâ€™t possibly create your brand</p>\r\n<p>Do what i call self analysis- identify what you are good at personally, What you want to work out. Find their striking point and pick up from there.</p>\r\n<ul type="circle">\r\n<li>Identify how your brand can be unique from others in the same space</li>\r\n<li>Can i excel in this particular skill?</li>\r\n<li>Will this skill bring you happiness and realization as your life progresses?</li>\r\n<ol align= â€œcentreâ€>Creating your Brand</ol>\r\n<li><b>Becoming an expert</b></li>- after discovering this skill, it becomes easier for you to improve on it since its something you know you enjoy doing. Discover similar fields that could help improve your brand and be familiar with them.\r\n<li><b>Generate a presence</b></li>- Even though you do not have the finance to put things in place now, make your presence known, have a journal where you put down your thoughts and ideas.<br/>\r\nThe best time to start publicising your brand is while you are still in school. Let your colleagues know you for who you are even if its something outside your field, so long you are interested in it.\r\n<li><b>Remember the 3 Cs of branding.</b></li> Clarity, consistency, constancy. Be clear in who you are and are not. Donâ€™t sugar-coat your qualifications. Express your brand across all communications mediums. Determine where you want to fit in and then remain visible to your target audience.\r\n<li><b.Get feedback from those who know you bestâ€”at work, at home, anywhere. </b></li>The true measure of your brand is the reputation others hold of you in their hearts and minds. Notice how they introduce you to others. Ask them what your top brand attributes and core strengths are. Be open to constructive critism.If they can easily tell you, then youâ€™ve succeeded in branding you.\r\n<li><b>Generate brand awareness through networking.</b></li> You should be connecting with other young professionals in the field by using social networks and commenting on their blogs. Networking is one of the best ways to become known in the industry. By forming relationships with people in your audience, you can grow your business and your brand long-term.\r\n<li><b>Nurture Your Network</b></li>\r\nYou should consistently engage your audience via social media and provide and compile relevant content for your audience that highlights your expertise. A blog is one of the most effective ways for creating this type of "expert" content. With the right platform you are able to disseminate this content to your audience with one click. Building a platform such as a blog and nurturing and growing a community are rocket fuel for your personal brand. \r\nOn a personal note, help yourself. You are marketting your brand, so prepare for a bigger picture.<b>Enhance your vocal skills, Read more, Your dress sense should speak for you. </b><br/>\r\nRemember that your personal brand definition should be aspirational: an indication of what you want out of life, not necessarily where you are right now.\r\nThe key here is to take control. You are your own brand manager, and you have to set the course for your own brand experience. Itâ€™s your show -- love your brand.\r\n', 0),

Yeaaa, youâ€™re welcome.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>Have some alone time</b></li>\r\nBeing alone and away from everything that can induce stress is definitely one of the best ways to relieve yourself of it.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Take naps when necessary</b></li>\r\nNapping has been shown to reduce cortisol levels, which aids in stress relief.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Self Induced Hypnosis</b></li>\r\nHypnosis can be self-induced, by trained relaxation, concentration on one''s own breathing, or by a variety of monotonous practices. \r\nResearch suggests hypnosis can help reduce anxiety. Go ahead, give it a whirl. You have nothing to lose but stress. \r\n<li><b>Live without technology</b></li>\r\nThere are times when the stress youâ€™re feeling is caused by the technology youâ€™re using. Take a day out in a week;best during weekends, and put away your smart phones, pc, tablets and whatever device you have just to have some You time\r\n<li><b>Have a good dose of laughter</b></li>\r\nLaughter can reduce the physical effects of stress (like fatigue) on the body. So watch something funny like a funny comedy show at your favorite comedy club.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Sing to yourself,dance, Listen to good Music</b></li>\r\nâ€œOh no my voice is horrible!â€ even better. Sing and make jest of yourself to yourself. Just have fun.<br/>\r\nResearch has shown that music can help relieve stress, from triggering biochemical stress reducers to helping patients deal with the stress associated with medical procedures.\r\n<li><b>Keep calm and breathe</b></li>\r\nWhen a particular thing/ task seem to be overwhelming, just keep calm and take a deep breath.\r\n<li><b>Keep a journal</b></li>\r\nSo much in your head, offload your brain. Keeping a journal may be one way to effectively relieve stress-related symptoms due to its meditative and reflective effects. So pick a time every day to write down a few things about your day or about your feelings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><b>Get a massage</b></li>\r\nThereâ€™s nothing like getting tense muscles loosened up by knowing hands. Studies suggest massage may be beneficial for fighting stress. It may also help improve body image. â€œSteve give me a massage, pleeaasseee!!â€\r\n\r\n<li><b>Take a break</b></li>\r\nGetting stressed out can certainly wear you down, so why not take a break once in a while? This gives you some â€œbreathing roomâ€ to relax and tackle the stressful situation with new energy. After all, youâ€™re not a machine.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Call a friend</b></li>\r\nIn times of stress, the power of friendship, coupled with human contact, can make a world of difference.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Take a walk</b></li>\r\nA quiet, meditative stroll can almost be miraculous for stress relief, especially when we step outdoors. The key is to walk at a slow steady pace.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Turn off the TV</b></li>\r\nWatching TV can induce stress. Its called self-discipline.

You donâ€™t even need any special training or equipment to do so. Just tense and then release each muscle group in the body. \r\n\r\n<li><b>Visualization</b></li>\r\nVisualizing a calm or peaceful scene may help reduce stress and ease anxiety by â€œtrickingâ€ the mind into a more relaxed state. \r\n<li><b>Yoga </b></li>\r\nThe combination of deep breathing techniques and poses makes this activity a powerhouse against stress.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Meditate</b></li>\r\nRuminate over your thoughts.

Hey, thinking is exhausting, take a meditation break.\r\n\r\n<li><b>Religion </b></li>\r\nResearch shows that college students who practiced a religion were less stressed than their non-religious counterparts.

Really want to be disciplined on how to save cash?,  try putting out this challenging tips into practice and see how far it helps you save more money. Good Luck!</p>\r\n<p><h2><b>Hide the Credit Cards </b></h2>\r\n\r\nMany students give into the temptation to buy now and pay later. Unfortunately, these spending habits can come back to bite you. If you find that you can''t charge responsibly, hide the credit cards until you learn a little restraint. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h2><b>Give Up Bad Habits </b></h2>\r\nEveryone has at least one bad habit. Maybe you smoke, drink, or buy expensive coffee before class. Whatever it is, cut it out. You''ll be surprised at how much money you save. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h2><b>Find Bargains( you are a student, donâ€™t be embarassed)</b></h2>\r\nWhen shopping, look for clearance items or two-for-one bargains, buy used books instead of new, and order the special instead of something off the menu. If you can find a bargain every time you go shopping, you will save more money than you ever imagined. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h2><b>Stop Keeping Up with the Neighbours </b></h2>\r\nJust because your roommate or your pals down the hall have a seemingly endless allowance, it doesn''t mean you do too. Try to avoid keeping up with the neighbour and stay true to your budget. </p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h2><b>Take Hand-Me-Downs </b></h2>\r\nWhether it is a used book or previously worn clothes, there is no shame in taking hand-me-downs. If somebody offers you something and you can use it, take it gratefully. When you''re making more money, you may be able to someday do the same thing for someone else who will be just as grateful. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\n<h2><b>Go to the Library </b></h2>\r\nDid you know that most libraries offer you the chance to check out DVDs, CDs, and other forms of entertainment free of charge? Well, they do, and by taking advantage of this resource, you can eliminate the money you spend on buying CDs and renting movies.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n<h2><b>Buy Machine Washable Clothes </b></h2>\r\nYou''re in college. You don''t need a dry cleaning bill! Buy clothes that you can wash yourself or take home to mom. If you must buy dry clean only clothes, try to limit how often you wear them. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><h2><b>Stay Home </b></h2>\r\nWhile it can be nice to get out of the dorm every now and then, staying at home is much cheaper. Instead of going out for the night, invite a few friends over for movies, games, gossip, or snacks. </p>\r\n<p><h2><b>Take Advantage </b></h2>\r\nTake advantage of what your campus has to offer in terms of activities, rather than spending money on going out. Many campuses have an array of museums, offer movie nights and other social events for cheaper or, sometimes, for free</P>\r\n<p><b>Other ways to save money at university </b>\r\nThereâ€™s nothing quite like the feeling of finding some spare change down the side of your couch. So why not save money by collecting all the change you can find in a jar? Plunge around and youâ€™ll be surprised at how fast this will add up. Use the coins for laundry, or when your jar is full you can take it to the bank and exchange all the coins youâ€™ve been saving for some brand new notes! Be careful of cash machines that charge you for taking your own money out. Itâ€™s always worth walking a little further to avoid the fee.</p>\r\n', 0),

These 18 straightforward ways to live differently are small changes that result in a big difference. Try giving them a shot.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>Think Big</b></li>\r\nMost people aim for what they think is attainable, but in reality, they are only giving in to limiting beliefs. Itâ€™s just as easy to think big as it is to think small; it only takes a small shift in your mindset. Besides, when you think small, you have to compete with everyone else who thinks that way. Think big, and youâ€™ll be in a class of your own\r\n\r\n<li><b>Make yourself wealthy, not someone else</b></li>\r\nWho owns the company you work for? If itâ€™s not you, then you are working to make someone else wealthy. If youâ€™re going to work hard, why not work hard for yourself?\r\nIf your thought of not having a platform of your own seems to be an excuse, are you doing something besides working for someone for yourself?. They could go side by side without disturbing each other; Am not asking you to be rebellious at work,just apply wisdom and know what you are doing.\r\n<li><b>Get inspired daily</b></li>\r\nMost people go through life without ever getting their heart pumping. Figure out what makes you tick ,what gets you going ,and drink from that well daily. \r\nThey say inspiration doesnt last long, so does bathing, thatâ€™s why its recomended dailly.\r\n<li><b>Get out of your comfort zone</b></li>\r\nDo something every day that scares you. Better yet, put yourself in the position where you have no choice but to be scared. The higher your tolerance for fear and uncertainty, the more likely you are to be remarkable.<br/>\r\nYou might never know what you are capable of doing until you find yourself in difficult situations.\r\n<li><b>Travel</b> </li>\r\nThe percentage of people who never see the outside world is overwhelming. If you want to understand how the world works, you need to get outside your bubble. Step outside the box\r\n<li><b>Be proactive</b></li>\r\nYou think something, do it. You say something, do it. You hear something, do it. Do not host both the necessary and unnecessary stuffs in your volatile brain.\r\n<li><b>Donâ€™t rely on the government( self sufficiency)</b></li>\r\nWant to take life into your own hands? You have the go ahead.but hey! Donâ€™t break the law.<br/>\r\nDonâ€™t leave it up to a bureaucracy . If you expect the government to take care of you, itâ€™s simply not going to happen. If you want to live differently, remember that nobody will look out for your well-being like you will. Every body is so busy thinking about themselves; and for this you cannot blame them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li><b>Stop doing what kills you</b></li>\r\nIts pretty plain and simple: We all know that some little things we do will eventually kill us. Yet we sneak around doing them. No moderation wonâ€™t kill us, but why do we succumb to what the rest of the masses do?\r\n<li><b>Do you live the dream?</b></li>\r\nBetween society, your family, and your friends, everyone has their own agendas for what they want to see you do. We live in a world where we strive for othersâ€™ approval without truly asking ourselves what we want. â€œLive the dreamâ€ means your dream, not someone elseâ€™s.\r\n<li><b>Train your mind</b></li>\r\nBigger isnâ€™t better when it comes to material things. As Notorious B.I.G. said, â€œMoâ€™ money, moâ€™ problems.â€ Bigger salary, bigger house, bigger car: itâ€™s more stuff occupying a BIG part of your life, and itâ€™s probably financed by moâ€™ debt. \r\n<li><b>Stop Paying for education</b></li>\r\nAll the information we need to educate ourselves is out there. Matt Damon said it best in Good Will Hunting: â€œIn 50 years, youâ€™re gonna start doing some thinking on your own, and youâ€™re gonna come up with the factâ€¦you dropped a hundred and fifty grand on an education you couldâ€™ve gotten for a dollar fifty in late charges at the public library.â€\r\n<li><b>Only buy stuff you can afford</b></li>\r\nItâ€™s a shocking thought, I know. Stop with the retail therapy at the expense of your pocket. Just because everyone lives beyond their means doesnâ€™t mean you have to.\r\n<li><b>Work out for 30 minutes, max</b></li>\r\nMost people go to the gym, mess around for 60 or 90 minutes, do something half-heartedly on the elliptical trainer, and roam from machine to machine. Work out at full intensity, pour sweat, and feel the burn! Youâ€™ll see twice the results if you actually push yourself instead of just showing up. Or better still take morning walks/ late noon strolls.\r\n<li><b>Work for 90 minutes, max</b></li>\r\nStudies show that your brain can only focus for an hour and a half, so donâ€™t force it! Work as hard and as fast as you can for 90 minutes, and then take a break. When you â€œworkâ€ aimlessly for hours on end, you never really accomplish anything.\r\n<li><b>Work outdoors</b></li>\r\nSure, there is a tremendous value in showing up to the office and being with your team every day, but this doesnâ€™t mean you canâ€™t sit in the park for an hour and do menial jobs; answer emails. Take your phone calls to a quiet place in the sun to get vitamin D and fresh air.\r\n<li><b>Stand, donâ€™t sit</b></li>\r\nOur bodies were simply not designed to be hunched over a computer all day. Make yourself mobile, and walk around when you have a phone call. Try out a standing desk. Flex your muscles\r\n<li><b>Become conservative</b><li> <b>Give to charity.</b> You really donâ€™t need all that stuff. Sell some of those stuffs, they weigh you down.<br/>\r\n<b>Stop drinking bottled water.</b> You are wasting money and not helping the environment.  Get a water bottle with a filter if necessary.<br/>\r\n<b>Use reusable coffee cups.</b> Think about all the Starbucks cups youâ€™ve sent to the landfill. Starbucks will give you a discount for bringing in your own cup, so take advantage. Save the environment and save money. Itâ€™s a no-brainer.<br/>\r\n<li><b>Do something Worthwhile</b></li>\r\n<b>Stop push notifications.</b>Why do you get alerts every time someone comments on Facebook, sends you spam, or â€œlikesâ€ your Instagram picture? If you want to be productive, check these means of communication on your own terms and turn off all push notifications on your phone.<br/>\r\n<b>Become cell phone-free.</b> You donâ€™t have to disconnect your service, but why not try â€œCell Phone-Free Sundaysâ€? There is no one more important than those you spend your Sundays with. Do yourself and/or your family a favor and disconnect.<br/>\r\n<b>Cut your cable.</b>Stop being brainwashed and getting sucked into channel flipping. Stop watching the life of the Kardashianâ€™s and live better.If you really want to occupy your mind with something worthwhile, start building up your book collection. Turn your living room into a library.\r\n<p  align=â€rightâ€>Source: the Internet</p>\r\n', 0),

The college challenge can be so grueling, that many venture to finish a college degree only to give up half way.

There is so much to do at all sorts of times. Make it a point to be aware of these activities so that you donâ€™t miss out on something that could potentially be of great interest to you. Visit the college website to look at their calendar or if your college has a newsletter/newspaper, make it a point to read it.\r\n<li><b>Go to classes prepared</b></li>\r\nThis is a bit elementary but it still rings through in college; always go to class prepared. If there are reading assignments that the professor wants you to read before class, make sure to read them. This will help you understand what the professor is talking about during his/her lecture. \r\n<li><b>Become familiar with your professors</b></li>\r\nBeing a teacherâ€™s pet in college is absolutely necessary. Get to know your teacher by asking questions during class and by visiting him or her during office hours. The more the professor is familiar with you, the easier it will be for him or her to help you when questions arise.\r\n<li><b>Be responsible when socializing </b></li>\r\nThere are too many distractions in the life of a college student. Things like part time (or even in some cases full-time) jobs, family, friends, and the social life will all want your attention. Before you know it, youâ€™re drained out of your mind and unable to focus on the very reason why you enrolled in college to begin with. Learn to prioritize and attend parties in moderation. There is nothing wrong with having fun, but always remember that your education is the main reason you are in college. \r\n<li><b>Continue learning</b></li>\r\nDuring the summer when all you really want to do is lounge around and do nothing, try to get up and make use of the time by learning other skills. You can also take the time to visit museums, or visit other destinations that are related to your field of study. Getting a part time job thatâ€™s related to your major would also be helpful\r\n<li.Decide on a major and stick with it</b></li>\r\nYou donâ€™t want to spend a longer amount of time in school compared to the rest of your peers do you? Decide on a major as soon as possible so you donâ€™t have to waste your time chasing frivolous endeavors. College is expensive. The faster you decide on a major, the faster you can leave college and the less money you spend on classes you donâ€™t need.\r\n<li><b>Donâ€™t hesitate to seek help</b></li>\r\nThis is tough for some people. Asking for help can sometimes seem like a sign of weakness. Do not fall into this false belief! In college, you will need to ask for help and ask often. Again, spend time with your teachers during office hours or join a study group.\r\n1.	Donâ€™t keep your hands too full\r\nCollege will give you many opportunities to do many things whether a fraternity, organization, volunteer work, etc. Though being active in college is good (really good actually), taking on more than you can handle is bad. Try to manage your time by being realistic with yourself. If you are a full-time student, you probably wonâ€™t be able to do as much extracurricular activities as you think you can.\r\n<li><b>Employ effective time management</b></li>\r\nTime is valuable. Once spent, you canâ€™t get it back. So treat it as such by prioritizing things you want to spend time on. Moreover, donâ€™t be afraid to say â€œNoâ€ to things or even people who are asking too much of your time.\r\n<li><b>Get your tuitionâ€™s worth by utilizing your schoolâ€™s resources</b></li>\r\nFor many colleges, the activity fee associated with your tuition enables you to use certain college facilities such as the library, the gym or recreation center, fields, conference rooms, etc. Familiarize yourself with what your college offers you and use it. All work and no play is just as unhealthy as all play and no work.\r\n<li><b>Jot down intelligible and comprehensive notes</b></li>\r\nSometimes we end up scribbling on random pieces of paper during class discussions and when class is over we just stick it in a book or in the bag. By the time you need to study for an important exam about that discussion, you lost the paper and youâ€™re obviously doomed. Jot down your notes on designated notebooks or notepads so you can study from them in one go.\r\n<li><b>Stay fit and healthy</b></li>\r\nEating healthy, exercising and getting ample sleep is a must when going through the rigors of college life as it will help you cope with stress. Run around the university or park, Use the Recreation Center, take up yoga, or go on hiking expeditions with your friends.\r\n<li><b>Keep in touch with family</b></li>\r\nDonâ€™t let the rigors of college keep you away from your family. Healthy family interactions will help you cope with the stress of college. Give your family a call once or twice a week, and make it a point to visit them during breaks. \r\n<li><b>Manage your finances wisely</b></li>\r\nNot everyone has the luxury of a full college education funded by parents or family members. Some end up working part time jobs and applying for student loans just to get through college. Even those whose tuition fees are paid for by their families sometimes still opt to work so they have extra money to spend. Budgeting expenses and avoiding unnecessary expenditures is highly essential if youâ€™re determined to survive in university life. \r\n<li><b>Master your study techniques</b></li>\r\nEveryone learns differently. Some peopleâ€™s learning style can be that of a visual learner, tactile learner, auditory learner or a reading-writing preference learner. Familiarize yourself with your learning style and modify your studying technique to your style.\r\n<li><b>Nurture professional connections and friendships</b></li>\r\nIn this world, your success will greatly depend on the connections you have. Start early to establish and nurture connections. Swap e-mails, social media invites, phone numbers, etc. in order to stay in touch. Plan to do activities with your connections in order to develop a stronger bond. Your future job will probably come from someone you know. \r\n</i><b>Organize your schedule</b></li>\r\nOrganization is important, especially when it comes to your schedule. Make it a point to keep your schedule organized in order that you may be able to see important dates and special events clearly. \r\n<li><b>Participate in extra curricular activities</b></li>\r\nWe alluded to this point earlier in the list, but extracurricular activities are important to your college experience. Not only will they give you an opportunity to learn new skills, but they will also enable you to make new connections with other people (and as you already know, connections are important). \r\n<li><b>Hone your writing skills.</b></li>\r\nWriting is a skill that you absolutely need to have perfected and not just for school papers. Future employers may ask to see a writing sample from you which will demonstrate the mastery of your writing skills (and could make or break the opportunity for a job). If you struggle with writing, spend some time reading grammar books. Granted, itâ€™s not the most exciting reading material in the world, but it will be well worth it in the future.\r\n<li><b>Read, read and read</b></li>\r\nThere is no way around it. In College, you will readâ€¦a lot. In fact, most of the theories and explanations behind the particular skill you are learning will be found within the pages of the assigned book. Your professor will expect you to have read the material in order that you may have complementary knowledge during his/her lecture. So donâ€™t neglect reading. \r\n<li><b>Set your goals and make them work for you</b></li>\r\nThere are short term goals as well as long term goals. Take things one step at a time and accomplish the shorter ones diligently so when you look at the larger picture, its easier for you to see the completion of your long term goals. Strengthen your heart and mind with each obstacle that you face and youâ€™ll see that accomplishing your goals gets easier as time passes by. \r\n<li><b>Take advantage of pre-owned books</b></li>\r\nBooks are really expensive. Be meager about college books and try not to purchase brand new books. Instead, look for used books. If you purchase your books two to three weeks before classes start, you may be able to find them online for a significantly cheaper price. \r\n<li><b>Take responsibility</b></li>\r\nBe proactive about your education and be responsible. Take it upon yourself to make the college experience a unique and awesome experience because no one is going to make that experience for you. Have the initiative to talk to your counselors about your goals and ask them for suggestions as to how to meet them.\r\n<li><b>Take your internship seriously</b></li>\r\nAlso known as Industrial Training(IT) in Nigeria. The temptation is to look at this opportunity as something other than a real job, but this is a very mistaken assumption. Remember, the person you are interning for could: (A) offer you a more permanent job and (B) have connections to someone who can offer you a more permanent job. The bottom line is, treat this opportunity as if you already had the job. \r\n<li><b>Thereâ€™s always something new to learn.</b></li>\r\nOne of the main goals in college is to teach you to learn (sounds weird I know) in order that you may know how to find information that you are not familiar with, and then become familiar with it. This is a skill that is in high demand yet few people possess. Never stop learning or finding unfamiliar information. \r\n\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n', 1);

(5, 4, 'probability', 'The Difference between Computer Animation and Computer Graphics Are:-\r\n1. Computer animation can be defined as the use of key frames and motion tools to move or give life to a static object.  To animate '' literally means to give life to. Animating is moving something that\r\ncannot move on its own. Animation adds to graphics the dimensions of time, which\r\nTremendously increase the potential of transmitting the desired information. In order to\r\nAnimate something the animator has to be able to specify directly or indirectly how the\r\n''Thing'' has to move through time and space. \r\nWhile Computer Graphic deals with the theory and techniques of computer image synthesis. Computers produce images by analyzing a collection of dots, or pixels (picture elements). Computer graphics is used to enhance the transfer and understanding of information in science, engineering, medicine, education, and business by facilitating the generation, production, and display of synthetic images of natural objects with realism almost indistinguishable from photographs.\r\n2. Computer Animation can be done in three dimensions (3D) While Computer Graphics can be done in Two Dimensions (that is 2D).\r\n3. During Design, the Computer Animator doesnâ€™t need to worry over camera orientation while a computer graphics designer has to specify the objects in the image and their shapes, positions, orientations, and surface colors or textures. Further, the viewer''s position and direction of view (camera orientation) must be specified\r\n3. Computer animation falls into three basic categories: key framing, motion capture, and simulation. Namely\r\nKey framing\r\nThe significance of the term "Key framing" can be traced back to traditional hand animation technique. Key framing requires that the animator specify critical or key positions for the objects. The computer then automatically fills in the missing frames by smoothly interpolating between those positions. The characters for a movie called Toy Story made in 1995 were designed through key frame animation. It''s believed that each character had as many as 700 controls. Key framing requires that the animator has a well thought out plan of how the moving objects are going to behave over time as well as the talent to express that information through key framed information. The continued popularity of key framing is a function of the degree of control that it allows the animator to exercise over the subtle details of the motion.\r\nMotion Capture\r\nAnother technique is Motion Capture, in which magnetic or vision-based sensors record the actions of a human or animal object in three dimensions. A computer then uses these data to animate the object. This technology has enabled a number of famous athletes to supply the actions for characters in sports video games. Motion capture is pretty popular with the animators mainly because some of the commonplace human actions can be captured with relative ease. However, there can be serious discrepancies between the shapes or dimensions of the subject and the graphical character and this may lead to problems of exact execution.\r\nSimulation:\r\nUnlike key framing and motion picture, simulation uses the laws of physics to generate motion of figures and other objects. Virtual humans are usually represented as a collection of rigid body parts. These models though physically plausible are only an approximation of the human body. With more research and complex models the simulations are becoming increasingly life like. Simulations can be easily used to produce slightly different sequences while maintaining physical realism while in other animations like key framing or motion capture a mere speeding up or slowing down the playback can spoil the naturalness of motion. Secondly real-time simulations allow a higher degree of interactivity where the real person can maneuver the actions of the simulated character. In contrast the applications based on key framing and motion select\r\nand modify motions form a recomputed library of motions. One drawback that simulation  suffers from is the expertise and time required to handcraft the appropriate controls systems \r\n\r\nWhile Computer Graphic has no room for playback and other interactive feature as those in a computer Animation.\r\nAlso the hardware and software requirement of most computers aided Animation is far different from the hardware, software requirement of computer graphic designs', 'The Difference between Computer Animation and Computer Graphics Are:-\r\n1.

The characters for a movie called Toy Story made in 1995 were designed through key frame animation. It''s believed that each character had as many as 700 controls. Key framing requires that the animator has a well thought out plan of how the moving objects are going to behave over time as well as the talent to express that information through key framed information. The continued popularity of key framing is a function of the degree of control that it allows the animator to exercise over the subtle details of the motion.\r\nMotion Capture\r\nAnother technique is Motion Capture, in which magnetic or vision-based sensors record the actions of a human or animal object in three dimensions. A computer then uses these data to animate the object. This technology has enabled a number of famous athletes to supply the actions for characters in sports video games. Motion capture is pretty popular with the animators mainly because some of the commonplace human actions can be captured with relative ease. However, there can be serious discrepancies between the shapes or dimensions of the subject and the graphical character and this may lead to problems of exact execution.\r\nSimulation:\r\nUnlike key framing and motion picture, simulation uses the laws of physics to generate motion of figures and other objects. Virtual humans are usually represented as a collection of rigid body parts. These models though physically plausible are only an approximation of the human body. With more research and complex models the simulations are becoming increasingly life like. Simulations can be easily used to produce slightly different sequences while maintaining physical realism while in other animations like key framing or motion capture a mere speeding up or slowing down the playback can spoil the naturalness of motion. Secondly real-time simulations allow a higher degree of interactivity where the real person can maneuver the actions of the simulated character. In contrast the applications based on key framing and motion select\r\nand modify motions form a recomputed library of motions. One drawback that simulation  suffers from is the expertise and time required to handcraft the appropriate controls systems \r\n\r\nWhile Computer Graphic has no room for playback and other interactive feature as those in a computer Animation.\r\nAlso the hardware and software requirement of most computers aided Animation is far different from the hardware, software requirement of computer graphic designs', 2, 1),

(4, '<p>Presumably every generation, since the beginning of human existence, somehow passed on its stock ... </p>', '<b>History of education</b>', '<p>Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases. Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated. The Epic of Gilgamesh, an epic poem from Ancient Mesopotamia is among the earliest known works of literary fiction. The earliest Sumerian versions of the epic date from as early as the Third Dynasty of Ur (2150-2000 BC) (Dalley 1989: 41-42).</p><br>\r\nAshurbanipal (685 â€“ c. 627 BC), a king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, was proud of his scribal education. His youthful scholarly pursuits included oil divination, mathematics, reading and writing as well as the usual horsemanship, hunting, chariotry, soldierliness, craftsmanship, and royal decorum. During his reign he collected cuneiform texts from all over Mesopotamia, and especially Babylonia, in the library in Nineveh, the first systematically organized library in the ancient Middle East, which survives in part today.<br>\r\n<p>Inancient Egypt, literacy was concentrated among an educated elite of scribes. Only people from certain backgrounds were allowed to train to become scribes, in the service of temple, pharaonic, and military authorities. The hieroglyph system was always difficult to learn, but in later centuries was purposely made even more so, as this preserved the scribes'' status. The rate of literacy in Pharaonic Egypt during most periods from the third to first millennium BC has been estimated at not more than one percent, or between one half of one percent and one percent.</p><br>\r\nIn ancient Israel the Torah (the fundamental religious text) includes commands to read, learn, teach and write the Torah, thus requiring literacy and study. In 64 AD the high priest caused schools to be opened . Emphasis was placed on developing good memory skills in addition to comprehension oral repetition. For details of the subjects taught, see History of education in ancient Israel and Judah. Although girls were not provided with formal education in the yeshivah, they were required to know a large part of the subject areas to prepare them to maintain the home after marriage, and to educate the children before the age of seven. <p>Despite this schooling system, it would seem that many children did not learn to read and write, because it has been estimated that "at least ninety percent of the Jewish population of Roman Palestine [in the first centuries AD] could merely write their own name or not write and read at all", or that the literacy rate was about 3 percent.</p>\r\n<h2><b>Indian Subcontinent</b></h2><br>\r\nIn ancient India, during the Vedic period from about 1500 BC to 600 BC, most education was based on the Veda (hymns, formulas, and incantations, recited or chanted by priests of a pre-Hindu tradition) and later Hindu texts and scriptures.\r\n<p>Vedic education included: proper pronunciation and recitation of the Veda, the rules of sacrifice, grammar and derivation, composition, versification and meter, understanding of secrets of nature, reasoning including logic, the sciences, and the skills necessary for an occupation. Some medical knowledge existed and was taught. There is mention in the Veda of herbal medicines for various conditions or diseases, including fever, cough, baldness, snake bite and others.<br>\r\nEducation, at first freely available in Vedic society, became over time more discriminatory as the caste system, originally based on occupation, evolved, with the brahman (priests) being the most privileged of the castes.<br>\r\nThe oldest of the Upanishads - another part of Hindu scriptures - date from around 500 BC. These texts encouraged an exploratory learning process where teachers and students were co-travellers in a search for truth. The teaching methods used reasoning and questioning. Nothing was labeled as the final answer.<br>\r\nThe Gurukul system of education supported traditional Hindu residential schools of learning; typically the teacher''s house or a monastery. Education was free, but students from well-to-do families paid "Gurudakshina," a voluntary contribution after the completion of their studies. At the Gurukuls, the teacher imparted knowledge of Religion, Scriptures, Philosophy, Literature,<br> Warfare, Statecraft, Medicine, Astrology and History. The corpus of Sanskrit literature encompasses a rich tradition of poetry and drama as well as technical scientific, philosophical and generally Hindu religious texts, though many central texts of Buddhism and Jainism have also been composed in Sanskrit.</p><br>\r\n<p>Two epic poems formed part of ancient Indian education. The Mahabharata, part of which may date back to the 8th century BC, discusses human goals (purpose, pleasure, duty, and liberation), attempting to explain the relationship of the individual to society and the world (the <br>nature of the ''Self'') and the workings of karma. The other epic poem, Ramayana, is shorter, although it has 24,000 verses. It is thought to have been compiled between about 400 BC and 200 AD. The epic explores themes of human existence and the concept of dharma.<br>\r\nAn early center of learning in India dating back to the 5th century BC was Taxila (also known as Takshashila), which taught the three Vedas and the eighteen accomplishments. It was an important Vedic/Hindu and Buddhistcentre of learning from the 6th century BC to the 5th century AD.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>China</b></h2>\r\n<p>During the Zhou Dynasty (1045 BC to 256 BC), there were five national schools in the capital city, Pi Yong (an imperial school, located in a central location) and four other schools for the aristocrats and nobility, including Shang Xiang. The schools mainly taught the Six Arts: rites,<br> music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics. According to the Book of Rituals, at age twelve, boys learned arts related to ritual (i.e. music and dance) and when older, archery and chariot driving. Girls learned ritual, correct deportment, silk production and weaving.<br>\r\nIt was during the Zhou Dynasty that the origins of native Chinese philosophy also developed. Confucius (551 BC â€“ 479 BC) founder of Confucianism, was a Chinese philosopher who made a great impact on later generations of Chinese, and on the curriculum of the Chinese educational system for much of the following 2000 years.<br>\r\n<p>Later, during the Ch''in dynasty (246-207 BC), a hierarchy of officials was set up to provide central control over the outlying areas of the empire. To enter this hierarchy, both literacy and knowledge of the increasing body of philosophy was required: "....the content of the educational process was designed not to engender functionally specific skills but rather to produce morally enlightened and cultivated generalists".<br>\r\nDuring the Han Dynasty (206 BC- 221 AD), boys were thought ready at age seven to start learning basic skills in reading, writing and calculation. In 124 BC, the Emperor Wudi established the Imperial Academy, the curriculum of which was the Five Classics of Confucius. By the end of the Han Dynasty (220 AD) the Academy enrolled more than 30,000 students, boys between the ages of fourteen and seventeen years. However education through this period was a luxury.<br>\r\n<p>The Nine rank system was a civil service nomination system during the Three Kingdoms (220-280 AD) and the Southern and Northern Dynasties (420-589 AD) in China. Theoretically, local government authorities were given the task of selecting talented candidates, then <br>categorizing them into nine grades depending on their abilities. In practice, however, only the rich and powerful would be selected. The Nine Rank System was eventually superseded by the Imperial examination system for the civil service in the Sui Dynasty (581-618 AD)</p>\r\n<h2><b>Greece and Rome</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>In the city-states of ancient Greece, most education was private, except in Sparta. For example, in Athens, during the 5th and 4th century BC, aside from two years military training, the state played little part in schooling. Anyone could open a school and decide the curriculum. Parents could choose a school offering the subjects they wanted their children to learn, at a <br>monthly fee they could afford. Most parents, even the poor, sent their sons to schools for at least a few years, and if they could afford it from around the age of seven until fourteen, learning gymnastics (including athletics, sport and wrestling), music (including poetry, drama and history) and literacy. Girls rarely received formal education. At writing school, the youngest students learned the alphabet by song, then later by copying the shapes of letters with a stylus on <br>a waxed wooden tablet. After some schooling, the sons of poor or middle-class families often learnt a trade by apprenticeship, whether with their father or another tradesman. By around 350 BC, it was common for children at schools in Athens to also study various arts such as drawing, painting, and sculpture. The richest students continued their education by studying with sophists, from whom they could learn subjects such as rhetoric, mathematics, geography, natural history, politics, and logic.<br> Some of Athens'' greatest schools of higher education included the Lyceum (the so-called Peripatetic school founded by Aristotle of Stageira) and the Platonic Academy (founded by Plato of Athens). The education system of the wealthy ancient Greeks is also called Paideia. In the subsequent Roman empire, Greek was the primary language of science. Advanced scientific research and teaching was mainly carried on in the Hellenistic side of the Roman empire, in Greek.</p><br>\r\n<p>The education system in the Greek city-state of Sparta was entirely different, designed to create warriors with complete obedience, courage, and physical perfection. At the age of seven, boys were taken away from their homes to live in school dormitories or military barracks. There they were taught sports, endurance and fighting, and little else, with harsh discipline. Most of the population was illiterate.<br>\r\nThe first schools in Ancient Rome arose by the middle of the 4th century BC. These schools were concerned with the basic socialization and rudimentary education of young Roman children. The literacy rate in the 3rd century BC has been estimated as around one percent to two percent. We have very few primary sources or accounts of Roman educational process until the 2nd century BC, during which there was a proliferation of private schools in Rome. At the height<br> of the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire, the Roman educational system gradually found its final form. Formal schools were established, which served paying students (very little in the way of free public education as we know it can be found). <br>Normally, both boys and girls were educated, though not necessarily together. In a system much like the one that predominates in the modern world, the Roman education system that developed arranged schools in tiers.</p><br><p>The educator Quintilian recognized the importance of starting education as early as possible, noting that â€œmemory â€¦ not only exists even in small children, but is specially retentive at that ageâ€. A Roman student would progress through schools just as a student today might go from elementary school to middle school, then to high school, and finally college. <br>Progression depended more on ability than age with great emphasis being placed upon a studentâ€™s ingenium or inborn â€œgiftâ€ for learning, and a more tacit emphasis on a studentâ€™s ability to afford high-level education. Only the Roman elite would expect a complete formal education. A tradesman or farmer would expect to pick up most of his vocational skills on the job. Higher education in Rome was more of a status symbol than a practical concern.<br></p>\r\n<p>It has been argued that literacy rates in the Greco-Roman world were seldom more than 20 percent; averaging perhaps not much above 10 percent in the Roman empire, though with wide regional variations, probably never rising above 5 percent in the western provinces, and that the<br> literate in classical Greece did not much exceed 5 percent of the population. The argument for these claims is that ancient governments did not invest in public education.</p>\r\n<h2><b>Formal education in the Middle Ages (500â€“1600 AD)</b></h2><br>\r\n<b>Europe</b><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/europe.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<p>The Abbey of Cluny was one of the most influential</p>\r\n<p>During the Early Middle Ages, the monasteries of the Roman Catholic Church were the centres of education and literacy, preserving the Church''s selection from Latin learning and maintaining the art of writing. Prior to their formal establishment, many medieval universities <br>were run for hundreds of years as Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (Scholaemonasticae), in which monks taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the early 6th century.<br>\r\nThe first medieval institutions generally considered to be universities were established in Italy, France, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology. These universities evolved from much older Christian cathedral schools and<br> monastic schools, and it is difficult to define the date on which they became true universities, although the lists of studiageneralia for higher education in Europe held by the Vatican are a useful guide.</p><br>\r\n<p>Ireland became known as the island of saints and scholars. Monasteries were built all over Ireland and these became centres of great learning.<br>\r\nNorthumbria was famed as a centre of religious learning and arts. Initially the kingdom was evangelized by monks from the Celtic Church, which led to a flowering of monastic life, and Northumbria played an important role in the formation of Insular art, a unique style combining Anglo-Saxon, Celtic, Byzantine and other elements. After the Synod of Whitby in 664 AD,<br> Roman church practices officially replaced the Celtic ones but the influence of the Anglo-Celtic style continued, the most famous examples of this being the Lindisfarne Gospels. The Venerable Bede (673-735) wrote his HistoriaecclesiasticagentisAnglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in 731) in a Northumbrian monastery, and much of it focuses on the kingdom.</p><br>\r\n<p>During the reign of Charlemagne, King of the Franks from 768 â€“ 814 AD, whose empire united most of Western Europe for the first time since the Romans, there was a flowering of literature, art, and architecture known as the Carolingian Renaissance.<br> Brought into contact with the culture and learning of other countries through his vast conquests, Charlemagne greatly increased the provision of monastic schools and scriptoria (centres for book-copying) in Francia. Most of the surviving works of classical Latin were copied and preserved by Carolingian scholars.<br>\r\nCharlemagne took a serious interest in scholarship, promoting the liberal arts at the court, ordering that his children and grandchildren be well-educated, and even studying himself under the tutelage of Paul the Deacon, from whom he learned grammar, Alcuin, with whom he studied rhetoric, dialect and astronomy (he was particularly interested in the movements of the stars), and Einhard, who assisted him in his studies of arithmetic. </p><br><p>The English monk Alcuin was invited to Charlemagne''s court at Aachen, and brought with him the precise classical Latin education that was available in the monasteries of Northumbria. The return of this Latin proficiency to the kingdom of the Franks is regarded as an important step in the development of <br>mediaeval Latin. Charlemagne''s chancery made use of a type of script currently known as Carolingian minuscule, providing a common writing style that allowed for communication across most of Europe. After the decline of the Carolingian dynasty, the rise of the Saxon Dynasty in Germany was accompanied by the Ottonian Renaissance.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/gem.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<p>Cambridge and many other universities were founded at this time.</p><br>\r\nCathedral schools and monasteries remained important throughout the Middle Ages; at the Third Lateran Council of 1179 the Church mandated that priests provide the opportunity of a free education to their flocks, and the 12th and 13th century renascence known as the Scholastic <br>Movement was spread through the monasteries.<br> These however ceased to be the sole sources of education in the 11th century when universities, which grew out of the monasticism began to be established in major European cities. Literacy became available to a wider class of people, and there were major advances in art, sculpture, music and architecture.<br>\r\nSculpture, paintings and stained glass windows were vital educational media through which Biblical themes and the lives of the saints were taught to illiterate viewers.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Islamic world</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>During the 6th and 7th centuries, the Academy of Gundishapur, originally the intellectual center of the Sassanid empire and subsequently a Muslim centre of learning, offered training in medicine, philosophy, theology and science. The faculty were versed not only in the Zoroastrian and Persian traditions, but in Greek and Indian learning as well.<br>\r\nThe House of Wisdom in Bagdad was a library, translation and educational centre from the 9th to 13th centuries. Works on astrology, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and philosophy were translated. Drawing on Persian, Indian and Greek textsâ€”including those of Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Euclid, Plotinus, Galen, Sushruta, Charaka, Aryabhata and <br>Brahmaguptaâ€”the scholars accumulated a great collection of knowledge in the world, and built on it through their own discoveries. The House was an unrivalled centre for the study of humanities and for sciences, including mathematics, astronomy, medicine, chemistry, zoology and geography.<br><p>Baghdad was known as the world''s richest city and centre for intellectual development of the time, and had a population of over a million, the largest in its time.\r\nThe Islamic mosque school (Madrasah) taught the Quran in Arabic and did not at all resemble the medieval European universities.<br>\r\nIn the 9th century, Bimaristan medical schools were formed in the medieval Islamic world, where medical diplomas were issued to students of Islamic medicine who were qualified to be a practicing Doctor of Medicine. Al-Azhar University, founded in Cairo, Egypt in 975, <br>was a Jami''ah ("university" in Arabic) which offered a variety of post-graduate degrees, had a Madrasah and theological seminary, and taught Islamic law, Islamic jurisprudence, Arabic <br>grammar, Islamic astronomy, early Islamic philosophy and logic in Islamic philosophy.</p><br>\r\n<p>Under the Ottoman Empire, the towns of Bursa and Edirne became major centers of learning.\r\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the town of Timbuktu in the West African nation of Mali became an Islamic centre of learning with students coming from as far away as the Middle East. <br>The town was home to the prestigious Sankore University and other madrasas. The primary focus of these schools was the teaching of the Qur''an, although broader instruction in fields such as logic, astronomy, and history also took place. Over time, there was a great accumulation of manuscripts in the area and an estimated 100,000 or more manuscripts, some of them dated from <br>pre-Islamic times and 12th century, are kept by the great families from the town. Their contents are didactic, especially in the subjects of astronomy, music, and botany. More than 18,000 manuscripts have been collected by the Ahmed Babacentre.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>China</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Although there are more than 40,000 Chinese characters in written Chinese, many are rarely used. Studies have shown that full literacy in the Chinese language requires a knowledge of only between three and four thousand characters.<br>\r\nIn China, three oral texts were used to teach children by rote memorization the written characters of their language and the basics of Confucian thought.\r\nThe Thousand Character Classic, a Chinese poem originating in the 6th century, was used for more than a millennium as a primer for teaching Chinese characters to children. <br>The poem is composed of 250 phrases of four characters each, thus containing exactly one thousand unique characters, and was sung in the same way that children learning the Latin alphabet may use the "alphabet song".</p><br>\r\n<p>Later, children also learn the Hundred Family Surnames, a rhyming poem in lines of eight characters composed in the early Song Dynasty (i.e. in about the 11th century) which actually listed more than four hundred of the common surnames in ancient China.<br>\r\nFrom around the 13th century until the latter part of the 19th century, the Three Character Classic, which is an embodiment of Confucian thought suitable for teaching to young children, served as a child''s first formal education at home. The text is written in triplets of characters for easy memorization. With illiteracy common for most people at the time, the oral tradition of reciting the classic ensured its popularity and survival through the centuries. <br>With the short and simple text arranged in three-character verses, children learned many common characters, grammar structures, elements of Chinese history and the basis of Confucian morality.\r\nAfter learning Chinese characters, students wishing to ascend in the social hierarchy needed to study the Chinese classic texts.<br>\r\n<p>The early Chinese state depended upon literate, educated officials for operation of the empire. In 605 AD, during the Sui Dynasty, for the first time, an examination system was explicitly instituted for a category of local talents. The merit-based imperial examination system for evaluating and selecting officials gave rise to schools that taught the Chinese classic texts and continued in use for 1,300 years, until the end the Qing Dynasty, being abolished in 1911 in favour of Western education methods. <br>The core of the curriculum for the imperial civil service examinations from the mid-12th century onwards was the Four Books, representing a foundational introduction to Confucianism.\r\nTheoretically, any male adult in China, regardless of his wealth or social status, could become a high-ranking government official by passing the imperial examination, although under some dynasties members of the merchant class were excluded. <br></p>In reality, since the process of studying for the examination tended to be time-consuming and costly (if tutors were hired), most of the candidates came from the numerically small but relatively wealthy land-owning gentry. <p>However, there are vast numbers of examples in Chinese history in which individuals moved from a low social status to political prominence through success in imperial examination. Under some dynasties the imperial examinations were abolished and official posts were simply sold, which increased corruption and reduced morale.<br>\r\nIn the period preceding 1040â€“1050 AD, prefectural schools had been neglected by the state and left to the devices of wealthy patrons who provided private finances. The chancellor of China at that time, Fan Zhongyan, issued an edict that would have used a combination of government funding and private financing to restore and rebuild all prefectural schools that had fallen into disuse and abandoned.<br>He also attempted to restore all county-level schools in the same manner, but did not designate where funds for the effort would be formally acquired and the decree was not taken seriously until a later period. Fan''s trend of government funding for education set in motion the movement of public schools that eclipsed private academies, which would not be officially reversed until the mid-13th century.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>India</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>The first millennium and the few centuries preceding it saw the flourishing of higher education at Nalanda, Takshashila University, Ujjain, &Vikramshila Universities. Amongst the subjects taught were Art, Architecture, Painting, Logic, mathematics, Grammar, Philosophy, Astronomy, Literature, Buddhism, Hinduism, Arthashastra (Economics & Politics), Law, and <br>Medicine. Each university specialized in a particular field of study. Takshila specialized in the study of medicine, while Ujjain laid emphasis on astronomy. Nalanda, being the biggest centre, handled all branches of knowledge, and housed up to 10,000 students at its peak.\r\nNalanda was a Buddhist center of learning founded in Bihar, India around the 5th century and conferred academic degree titles to its graduates, while also offering post-graduate courses.<br> It has been called "one of the first great universities in recorded history."\r\nVikramaÅ›Ä«la University, another important center of Buddhist learning in India, was established by King Dharmapala (783 to 820) in response to a supposed decline in the quality of scholarship at NÄlandÄ.</p><br>\r\n<p>Indigenous education was widespread in India in the 18th century, with a school for every temple, mosque or village in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion. The schools were attended by students representative of all classes of society.</p>\r\n<h2><b>Japan</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>The history of education in Japan dates back at least to the 6th century, when Chinese learning was introduced at the Yamato court. Foreign civilizations have often provided new ideas for the development of Japan''s own culture.<br>\r\nChinese teachings and ideas flowed into Japan from the sixth to the 9th century. Along with the introduction of Buddhism came the Chinese system of writing and its literary tradition, and Confucianism.\r\nBy the 9th century, Heian-kyo (today''s Kyoto), the imperial capital, had five institutions of higher learning, and during the remainder of the Heian period, other schools were established by the nobility and the imperial court. <br>During the medieval period (1185-1600), Zen Buddhist monasteries were especially important centers of learning, and the Ashikaga School, Ashikaga Gakko, flourished in the 15th century as a center of higher learning.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Central and South American civilizations</b></h2><br>\r\n<b>Aztec</b>\r\n<p>Aztec is a term used to refer to certain ethnic groups of central Mexico, particularly those groups who spoke the Nahuatl language and who achieved political and military dominance over large parts of Mesoamerica in the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, a period referred to as the Late post-Classic period in Mesoamerican chronology.<br>\r\nUntil the age of fourteen, the education of children was in the hands of their parents, but supervised by the authorities of their calpÅlli. Part of this education involved learning a collection of sayings, called huÄ“huetlÃ tolli ("sayings of the old"), that embodied the Aztecs'' ideals. Judged by their language, most of the huÄ“huetlatolli seemed to have evolved over several centuries, predating the Aztecs and most likely adopted from other Nahua cultures.</p><br>\r\n<p>At 15, all boys and girls went to school. The Mexica, one of the Aztec groups, were one of the first people in the world to have mandatory education for nearly all children, regardless of gender, rank, or station.There were two types of schools: the telpochcalli, for practical and<br> military studies, and the calmecac, for advanced learning in writing, astronomy, statesmanship, theology, and other areas. The two institutions seem to be common to the Nahua people, leading some experts to suggest that they are older than the Aztec culture.\r\nAztec teachers (tlatimine) propounded a spartan regime of education with the purpose of forming a stoical people.<br>\r\nGirls were educated in the crafts of home and child raising. They were not taught to read or write. All women were taught to be involved in religion; there are paintings of women presiding over religious ceremonies, but there are no references to female priests.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Inca</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Inca education during the time of the Inca Empire in the 15th and 16th centuries was divided into two principal spheres: education for the upper classes and education for the general population. The royal classes and a few specially chosen individuals from the provinces of the Empire were formally educated by the Amautas (wise men), while the general population learned knowledge and skills from their immediate forbears.<br>\r\nThe Amautas constituted a special class of wise men similar to the bards of Great Britain. They included illustrious philosophers, poets, and priests who kept the oral histories of the Incas alive by imparting the knowledge of their culture, history, customs and traditions throughout the kingdom.<br></p><p> Considered the most highly educated and respected men in the Empire, the Amautas were largely entrusted with educating those of royal blood, as well as other young members of conquered cultures specially chosen to administer the regions. Thus, education throughout the territories of the Incas was socially discriminatory, most people not receiving the formal education that royalty received.<br>\r\nThe official language of the empire was Quechua, although dozens if not hundreds of local languages were spoken. The Amautas did ensure that the general population learn Quechua as the language of the Empire, much in the same way the Romans promoted Latin throughout Europe; however, this was done more for political reasons than educational ones.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>After the 15th century</b></h2><br>\r\n<b><h2>Europe</h2></b>\r\n<b>Europe overview</b>\r\n<center><img src="logo/europe2.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<p>Primary School in "open air".Teacher with class, from the outskirts of Bucharest, around 1842.\r\nModern systems of education in Europe derive their origins from the schools of the High Middle Ages. Most schools during this era were founded upon religious principles with the primary purpose of training the clergy. Many of the earliest universities, such as the University of Paris founded in 1160, had a Christian basis.<br> In addition to this, a number of secular universities existed, such as the University of Bologna, founded in 1088. Free education for the poor was officially mandated by the Church in 1179 when it decreed that every cathedral must assign a master to teach boys too poor to pay the regular fee; parishes and monasteries also established free schools teaching at least basic literary skills.<br> With few exceptions, priests and brothers taught locally, and their salaries were frequently subsidized by towns. Private, independent schools reappeared in medieval Europe during this time, but they, too, were religious in nature and mission. The curriculum was usually based around the trivium and to a lesser extent quadrivium (the seven ArtesLiberales or Liberal arts) and was conducted in Latin, the lingua franca of educated Western Europe throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance.<br></p>\r\n<p>In northern Europe this clerical education was largely superseded by forms of elementary schooling following the Reformation. In Scotland, for instance, the national Church of Scotland set out a programme for spiritual reform in January 1561 setting the principle of a school teacher for every parish church and free education for the poor. <br>This was provided for by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland, passed in 1633, which introduced a tax to pay for this programme. Although few countries of the period had such extensive systems of education, the period between the 16th and 18th centuries saw education become significantly more widespread.<br>\r\nIn Central Europe, the 17th century scientist and educator John Amos Comenius promulgated a reformed system of universal education that was widely used in Europe.\r\nThis growth resulted in increased government interest in education. In the 1760s, for instance, Ivan Betskoy was appointed by the Russian Tsarina, Catherine II, as educational advisor. He proposed to educate young Russians of both sexes in state boarding schools, aimed at creating "a new race of men".<br></p>Betskoy set forth a number of arguments for general education of children rather than specialized one: "in regenerating our subjects by an education founded on these principles, we will create... new citizens." Some of his ideas were implemented in the Smolny Institute that he established for noble girls in Saint Petersburg.<br>\r\nBetskoy''s work in Russia was soon followed by the Polish establishment in 1773 of a Commission of National Education (Polish: KomisjaEdukacjiNarodowej, Lithuanian: NacionalineEdukacineKomisija). The commission functioned as the first government Ministry of Education in a European country.\r\nMeanwhile, there was an increasing academic interest in education and the first attempts to create what might be considered academic rationales for teaching methods. <br>This led, in the 1770s, to the establishment of the first chair of pedagogy at the University of Halle in Germany. Contributions to the study of education elsewhere in Europe included the work of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi in Switzerland and Joseph Lancaster in Britain.<br></p>\r\n<p>Under the guidance of Wilhelm von Humboldt a new university was founded in Berlin in 1810 which became the model for many research universities. Herbart developed a system of pedagogy widely used in German-speaking areas.<br>\r\nIn the late 19th century, most of West, Central, and parts of East Europe began to provide elementary education in reading, writing, and arithmetic, partly because politicians believed that education was needed for orderly political behavior. <br>As more people became literate, they realized that most secondary education was only open to those who could afford it. Having created primary education, the major nations had to give further attention to secondary education by the time of World War I.<br>\r\nIn 1884, a groundbreaking education conference was held in London at the International Health Exhibition, attracting specialists from all over Europe.\r\nIn the 20th century, new directions in education included, in Italy, Maria Montessori''s Montessori schools; and in Germany, Rudolf Steiner''s development of Waldorf education.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>France</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>While the French trace the development of their educational system to Charlemagne, the modern era of French education begins at the end of the 19th century. Jules Ferry, a lawyer holding the office of Minister of Public Instruction in the 1880s, is widely credited for creating the modern Republican school (l''Ã©colerÃ©publicaine) by requiring all children under the age of 15â€”boys and girlsâ€”to attend. He also made public instruction free of charge and secular (laÃ¯que).</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Japan</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Japan isolated itself from 1600 under the Tokugawa regime (1600â€“1867). In 1600 very few common people were literate. By the period''s end, learning had become widespread. Tokugawa education left a valuable legacy: an increasingly literate populace, a meritocratic ideology, and an emphasis on discipline and competent performance. Traditional Samurai curricula for elites stressed morality and the martial arts. <br>Confucian classics were memorized, and reading and recitation of them were common methods of study. Arithmetic and calligraphy were also studied. Education of commoners was generally practically oriented, providing basic 3-Rs, calligraphy and use of the abacus. Much of this education was conducted in so-called temple schools (terakoya), derived from earlier Buddhist schools. These schools were no longer religious institutions, nor were they, by 1867, predominantly located in temples. <br>By the end of the Tokugawa period, there were more than 11,000 such schools, attended by 750,000 students. Teaching techniques included reading from various textbooks, memorizing, abacus, and repeatedly copying Chinese characters and Japanese script. By the 1860s, 40-50% of Japanese boys, and 15% of the girls, had some schooling outside the home. These rates were comparable to major European nations at the time (apart from Germany, which had compulsory schooling).<br> Under subsequent Meiji leadership, this foundation would facilitate Japan''s rapid transition from feudal society to modern nation which paid very close attention to Western science, technology and educational methods. </p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Meiji reforms</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>After 1868 reformers set Japan on a rapid course of modernization, with a public education system like that of Western Europe. Missions like the Iwakura mission were sent abroad to study the education systems of leading Western countries. They returned with the ideas of decentralization, local school boards, and teacher autonomy.<br>Elementary school enrollments climbed from about 40 or 50 percent of the school-age population in the 1870s to more than 90 percent by 1900, despite strong public protest, especially against school fees.\r\nA modern concept of childhood emerged in Japan after 1850 as part of its engagement with the West. Meiji era leaders decided the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals - and children - in service of the state.<br>The Western-style school became the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood. After 1890 Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who bought into the new sensibility. They taught the upper middle class a model of childhood that included children having their own space where they read children''s books, played with educational toys and, especially, devoted enormous time to school homework. These ideas rapidly disseminated through all social classes.</p><br>\r\n<p>After 1870 school textbooks based on Confucianism were replaced by westernized texts. However by the 1890s, a reaction set in and a more authoritarian approach was imposed. Traditional Confucian and Shinto precepts were again stressed, especially those concerning the hierarchical nature of human relations, service to the new state, the pursuit of learning, and morality. <br>These ideals, embodied in the 1890 Imperial Rescript on Education, along with highly centralized government control over education, largely guided Japanese education until 1945, when they were massively repudiated.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>India</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Education was widespread for elite young men in the 18th century, with a schools in most regions of the country. The subjects taught included Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Theology, Law, Astronomy, Metaphysics, Ethics, Medical Science and Religion.<br>\r\nThe current system of education, with its western style and content, was introduced and founded by the British during the British Raj, following recommendations by Lord Macaulay. Traditional structures were not recognized by the British government and have been on the decline since.<br>\r\nPublic education expenditures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries varied dramatically across regions with the western and southern provinces spending three to four times as much as the eastern provinces. Much of the inter-regional differential was due to historical differences in land taxes, the major source of revenue.<br>\r\nLord Curzon, the Viceroy 1899-1905, made mass education a high priority after finding that no more than 20% of India''s children attended school. His reforms centered on literacy training and on restructuring of the university systems. They stressed ungraded curricula, modern textbooks, and new examination systems. Curzon''s plans for technical education laid the foundations which were acted upon by later governments.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Norway</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Organized education in Norway dates as far back as medieval times. Shortly after Norway became an archdiocese in 1152, cathedral schools were constructed to educate priests in Trondheim, Oslo, Bergen and Hamar.\r\nAfter the reformation of Norway in 1537, (Norway entered a personal union with Denmark in 1536) the cathedral schools were turned into Latin schools, and it was made mandatory for all market towns to have such a school.<br>\r\nIn 1736 training in reading was made compulsory for all children, but was not effective until some years later. In 1827, Norway introduced the folkeskole, a primary school which became mandatory for 7 years in 1889 and 9 years in 1969. In the 1970s and 1980s, the folkeskole was abolished, and the grunnskole was introduced.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>New Zealand</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Education began with provision made by the provincial government, the missionary Christian churches and private education. The first act of parliament for education was passed in 1877, and sought to establish a standard for primary education. It was compulsory for children to attend school until the age of 14 years.</p>\r\n<h2><b>Imperial Russia and the Soviet Union</b></h2><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/russia.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<p>Mental Calculations.In the school of S.Rachinsky by NikolayBogdanov-Belsky. 1895.\r\nIn Imperial Russia, according to the 1897 Population Census, literate people made up 28.4 percent of the population. During the 8th Party Congress of 1919, the creation of the new Socialist system of education was proclaimed the major aim of the Soviet government. The abolition of illiteracy became the primary task in the Russian .<br>\r\nIn accordance with the Sovnarkom decree of December 26, 1919, signed by its head Vladimir Lenin, the new policy of likbez, was introduced. The new system of universal compulsory education was established for children. Millions of illiterate adult people all over the country, including residents of small towns and villages, were enrolled in special literacy schools.<br>Komsomol members and Young Pioneer detachments played an important role in the education of illiterate people in villages. The most active phase of likbez lasted until 1939. In 1926, the literacy rate was 56.6 percent of the population. By 1937, according to census data, the literacy rate was 86% for men and 65% for women, making a total literacy rate of 75%. </p><br>\r\n<p>An important aspect of the early campaign for literacy and education was the policy of "indigenization" (korenizatsiya). This policy, which lasted essentially from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s, promoted the development and use of non-Russian languages in the government, the media, and education. Intended to counter the historical practices of Russification, it had as another practical goal assuring native-language education as the quickest way to increase educational levels of future generations.<br> A huge network of so-called "national schools" was established by the 1930s, and this network continued to grow in enrollments throughout the Soviet era. Language policy changed over time, perhaps marked first of all in the government''s mandating in 1938 the teaching of Russian as a required subject of study in every non-Russian school, and then especially beginning in the latter 1950s a growing conversion of non-Russian schools to Russian as the main medium of instruction.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>United States of America</b></h2><br>\r\n<h2><b>Africa</b></h2>\r\n<p>Until at least 1900 AD, in most African countries south of the Sahara, children received traditional informal education on matters such as artistic performances, ceremonies, rituals, games, festivals, dancing, singing, and drawing. Boys and girls were taught separately to help prepare each sex for their adult roles. <br>Every member of the community had a hand in contributing to the educational upbringing of the child. The high point of the African educational experience was the ritual passage ceremony from childhood to adulthood.\r\nNowadays, many sub-Saharan African countries have low rates of participation in formal education. Schools often lack basic facilities, and African universities may suffer from overcrowding and the difficulties of retaining staff attracted overseas by higher pay and better conditions.<br>\r\nAfrica has more than 40 million children. According to UNESCO''s Regional overview on sub-Saharan Africa, in 2000 only 58% of children were enrolled in primary schools, the lowest enrollment rate of any region. The USAID Center reports as of 2005, forty percent of school-aged children in Africa do not attend primary school.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Recent world-wide trends</b></h2><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/recent.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n\r\nWorld map indicating Education Index (2007/2008 Human Development Report) \r\n  0.950 and over\r\n  0.900â€“0.949\r\n  0.850â€“0.899\r\n  0.800â€“0.849\r\n  0.750â€“0.799	  0.700â€“0.749\r\n  0.650â€“0.699\r\n  0.600â€“0.649\r\n  0.550â€“0.599\r\n  0.500â€“0.549	  0.450â€“0.499\r\n  0.400â€“0.449\r\n  0.350â€“0.399\r\n  under 0.350\r\n  not available\r\n<p>Nowadays some kind of education is compulsory to all people in most countries. Due to population growth and the proliferation of compulsory education, UNESCO has calculated that in the next 30 years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.<br>\r\nIlliteracy and the percentage of populations without any schooling have decreased in the past several decades. For example, the percentage of population without any schooling decreased from 36% in 1960 to 25% in 2000.\r\nAmong developing countries, illiteracy and percentages without schooling in 2000 stood at about half the 1970 figures. Among developed countries, figures about illiteracy rates differ widely. <br>Often it is said that they decreased from 6% to 1%. Illiteracy rates in less economically developed countries (LEDCs) surpassed those of more economically developed countries (MEDCs) by a factor of 10 in 1970, and by a factor of about 20 in 2000. Illiteracy decreased greatly in LEDCs, and virtually disappeared in MEDCs. Percentages without any schooling showed similar patterns.<br>\r\nPercentages of the population with no schooling varied greatly among LEDCs in 2000, from less than 10% to over 65%. MEDCs had much less variation, ranging from less than 2% to 17%.</p>', '1389795370ing_Bucharest_1842.jpg', 1, '0000-00-00');

Private schools would also offer Computer science, French, and Fine Arts. Primary school students are required to take a Common Entrance Examination to qualify for admission into the Federal and State Government Secondary schools, as well as private ones.<br>\r\nThe Universal Basic Education, UBE, came as a replacement for Nigeriaâ€™s Universal Primary Education scheme of the 6-3-3-4 system of primary education. The 9-3-4 system of education was designed in conformity with the MDGs and Education For All, EFA (Kayode, 2006). The UBE involves 6 years of Primary School education and 3 years of Junior Secondary School education, culminating in 9 years of uninterrupted schooling, and transition from one class to another is automatic but determined through continuous assessment. This scheme is monitored by the Universal Basic Education Commission, UBEC, and has made it "free", "compulsory" and a right of every child.<br> Therefore, the UBEC law section 15 defines UBE as early childhood care and education. The law stipulates a 9-year formal schooling, adult literacy and non-formal education, skill acquisition programs and the education of special groups such as nomads and migrants, girl child and women, Al-majiri, street children and disabled people (Aderinoye, 2007).</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Secondary education</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Students spend six years in Secondary School, that is 3 years of JSS (Junior Secondary School), and 3 years of SSS (Senior Secondary School). By Senior Secondary School Class 2 (SS2), students are taking the GCE Oâ€™Levels exam, which is not mandatory, but most students take it to prepare for the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination.<br> The Senior Secondary School Exam is taken in the last year of secondary school (SS3). Private organizations, the State government or the Federal government manage secondary schools in Nigeria.\r\nThe Federal Republic of Nigeria is made up of thirty-six States and the Federal Capital Territory. There are about two Federal Government Colleges in each state. These schools are funded and managed directly by the Federal Government through the Ministry of Education. Teachers and staff are Federal Government employees. <br>Teachers at the Federal Government schools possess a Bachelors degree in Education or in a particular subject area, such as, Mathematics, Physics etc. These schools are supposed to be model schools carrying and maintaining the ideals of secondary education for Nigerian students. Admission is based on merit, determined by the National Common Entrance Examination taken by all final year elementary school pupils. Tuition and fees are very low, approximately sixteen thousand naira (#16000,00:00), because funding comes from the Federal Government.</p><br>\r\n<p>State-owned secondary schools are funded by each state government and are not comparable to the Federal government colleges. Although education is supposed to be free in the majority of the state owned institutions, students are required to purchase books, uniforms and pay for miscellaneous things costing them an average of thirty thousand naira (#2000,00:00) in an academic year. <br>Teachers in State-owned institutions usually have a National Certificate of Education or a Bachelors Degree, but this is not always the case as many secondary schools in Nigeria are filled with unqualified teachers who end up not being able to motivate the students. Often these schools are understaffed due to low state budgets, lack of incentives and irregularities in payment of staff salaries.<br> Some state-owned secondary schools are regarded as elite colleges because of the historically high educational standard and producing alumni who have prominent citizens in the various careers. These included King''s College, Lagos and Queen''s College, Lagos. However, the college ranking of these institutions have since dropped because of the arrival of some private institutions.<br>\r\n</p><p>Private secondary schools in Nigeria tend to be quite expensive with average annual fees averaging from one hundred and sixty to three hundred and twenty thousand naira(#16000,00:00 - #32000,00:00). These schools have smaller classes (approximately twenty to thirty students per class), modern equipment and a better environment. Most teachers in these institutions possess at least a Bachelors Degree in a specific course area and are sent for workshops or short term programs on a regular basis.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Promotional examinations</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>With the introduction of 6-3-3-4 system of education in Nigeria, the recipient of the education would spend six years in primary school, three years in junior secondary school,three years in senior secondary school, and four years in tertiary institution.The six years spent in primary school and the three years spent in junior secondary school are merged to form the nine in the 9-3-4 system. Altogether, the students must spend a minimum period of six years in Secondary School. During this period, students are expected to spend three years in Junior Secondary School and three years in Senior Secondary School.<br>\r\nThe General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE) was replaced by the Senior Secondary Certificate Examination (SSCE). The SSCE is conducted at the end of the Secondary School studies in May/June. The GCE is conducted in October/November as a supplement for those students who did not get the required credits from their SSCE results.<br> The standards of the two examinations are basically the same. A body called West African Examination Council (WAEC) conducts both the SSCE and GCE. A maximum of nine and a minimum of seven subjects are registered for the examination by each student with Mathematics and English Language taking as compulsory.<br>\r\nA maximum of nine grades are assigned to each subject from: A1, B2, B3 (Equivalent to Distinctions Grade); C4, C5, C6 (Equivalent to Credit Grade); D7, E8 (Just Pass Grade); F9 (Fail Grade). Credit grades and above is considered academically adequate for entry into any University in Nigeria. In some study programs, many of the universities may require higher grades to get admission.</p><br><p>\r\nThe Federal Government policy on education is adhered to by all secondary schools in Nigeria. Six years of elementary school is followed by six years of secondary school. Senior Secondary school consists of the SS I, SS 2, and SS 3 which is equivalent to the 10th, 11th and 12th Grade. The Senior Secondary School Examination (SSCE) is taken at the end of the SS 3.<br> The West African Examination Council (WAEC) administers both exams. Three to six months after a student has taken the SSCE examination, they are issued an official transcript from their institution. This transcript is valid for one year, after which an Official transcript from the West African Examination Council is issued.<br>\r\nNational Examination Council is another examination body in Nigeria Senior Secondary School Examination (SSCE)in June/July. The body also administer General Certificate of Education Examination (GCE)in December/January. The students often take both WAEC and NECO examinations in SSS 3.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Tertiary education</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>The government has majority control of university education. The country has a total number of 128 universities registered by NUC among which federal and state government own 40 and 38 respectively while 50 universities are privately owned.<br>\r\nFirst year entry requirements into most universities in Nigeria include: Minimum of SSCE/GCE Ordinary Level Credits at maximum of two sittings; Minimum cut-off marks in Joint Admission and Matriculation Board Entrance Examination (JAMB) of 180 and above out of a maximum of 400 marks are required. Candidates with minimum of Merit Pass in National Certificate of Education (NCE), National Diploma (ND) and other Advanced Level Certificates minimum qualifications with minimum of 5 O/L Credits are given direct entry admission into the appropriate undergraduate degree programs.<br>\r\nStudents normally enter university from age 18 onwards, and study for an academic degree. Historically, universities are divided into several tiers:<br>\r\n<b><h2>First Generation Universities</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Five of these Universities were established between 1948 and 1965, following the recommendation of the Ashby Commission set up by the British Colonial Government to study the necessity of university education for Nigeria. These universities are fully funded by the federal government. <br>They were established primarily to meet a need for qualified personnel in Nigeria and to set basic standards for university education. These universities have continued to play their roles for the production of qualified personnel and the provision of standards, which have helped to guide the subsequent establishments of other generations of universities in Nigeria. Universities in this tier include the University of Nigeria, Nsukka and the University of Ibadan.</p><br>\r\n</h2></b>Second Generation Universities</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>With the increasing population of qualified students for university education in Nigeria and the growing needs for scientific and technological developments, setting up more universities became imperative. Between 1970 and 1985, 12 additional universities were established and located in various parts of the country.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Third Generation Universities</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>The need to establish Universities to address special areas of Technological and Agricultural demand prompted the setting up of 10 additional Universities between 1985 and 1999.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>State Universities</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>Pressures from qualified students from each state who could not readily get admissions to any of the Federal Universities continued to mount on States Governments. It became imperative and urgent for some State Governments to invest in the establishment of Universities.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Private Universities</b></h2><br>\r\n<p>In recognition of the need to encourage private participation in the provision of university education, the Federal Government established a law in 1993, allowing private sectors to establish universities following guidelines prescribed by the Government.</p><br>\r\n<p>The typical duration of undergraduate programs in Nigerian universities depends largely on the program of study. For example, Social Sciences/Humanity related courses are 4 Years, Engineering/Technology related courses are 5 Years, Pharmacy courses are 5 Years, and Law courses are 5 Years, each with two semester sessions per year. Medicine (Vet/Human) degrees take 6 Years and have longer sessions during the year.</p><br>\r\n<h2><bWomen in education</b></h2><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/women_nigeria.PNG" width="200" height="200"><center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<h2></b>description=Female literacy rate in Nigeria by state in 2013</b ></h2><br>\r\n  > 90% ,\r\n  80-90%,\r\n  70-80%,\r\n  60-70%,\r\n  50-60%,\r\n  35-50%,\r\n  < 35%,\r\n</br/>\r\n<p>Education has been recognized as a basic human right since the 1948 adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

(6, 'General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915.', 'History of general relativity', '<b>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</b><br>\r\n\r\n<p>General relativity (GR) is a theory of gravitation that was developed by Albert Einstein between 1907 and 1915, with contributions by many others after 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of space and time by those masses.<br>\r\nBefore the advent of general relativity, Newton''s law of universal gravitation had been accepted for more than two hundred years as a valid description of the gravitational force between masses, even though Newton himself did not regard the theory as the final word on the nature of gravity. Within a century of Newton''s formulation, careful astronomical observation revealed unexplainable variations between the theory and the observations. Under Newton''s model, <br>gravity was the result of an attractive force between massive objects. Although even Newton was bothered by the unknown nature of that force, the basic framework was extremely successful at describing motion.</p><br><p>\r\nHowever, experiments and observations show that Einstein''s description accounts for several effects that are unexplained by Newton''s law, such as minute anomalies in the orbits of Mercury and other planets. General relativity also predicts novel effects of gravity, such as gravitational waves, gravitational lensing and an effect of gravity on time known as gravitational time dilation.<br> Many of these predictions have been confirmed by experiment, while others are the subject of ongoing research. For example, although there is indirect evidence for gravitational waves, direct evidence of their existence is still being sought by several teams of scientists in experiments such as the LIGO and GEO 600 projects.\r\nGeneral relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. <br>It provides the foundation for the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Creation of general relativity</h2></b><br>\r\n<b>Early investigations</b>\r\n<p>As Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was the preference of inertial motion within special relativity, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) appeared more satisfactory to him. So, while still working at the patent office in 1907, Einstein had what he would call his "happiest thought". He realized that the principle of relativity could be extended to gravitational fields.<br>\r\nConsequently, in 1907 (published 1908) he wrote an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article, he argued that free fall is really inertial motion, and that for a freefalling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the Equivalence principle. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomenon of gravitational time dilation.\r\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article expanding on the 1907 article. There, he thought about the case of a uniformly accelerated box not in a gravitational field, and noted that it would be indistinguishable from a box sitting still in an unchanging gravitational field.<br> He used special relativity to see that the rate of clocks at the top of a box accelerating upward would be faster than the rate of clocks at the bottom. He concludes that the rates of clocks depend on their position in a gravitational field, and that the difference in rate is proportional to the gravitational potential to first approximation.\r\nAlso the deflection of light by massive bodies was predicted. Although the approximation was crude, it allowed him to calculate that the deflection is nonzero. German astronomer Erwin Finlay-Freundlich publicized Einstein''s challenge to scientists around the world. <br>This urged astronomers to detect the deflection of light during a solar eclipse, and gave Einstein confidence that the scalar theory of gravity proposed by Gunnar NordstrÃ¶m was incorrect. But the actual value for the deflection that he calculated was too small by a factor of two, because the approximation he used doesn''t work well for things moving at near the speed of light. When Einstein finished the full theory of general relativity, he would rectify this error and predict the correct amount of light deflection by the sun.<br>\r\nAnother of Einstein''s notable thought experiments about the nature of the gravitational field is that of the rotating disk (a variant of the Ehrenfest paradox). He imagined an observer making experiments on a rotating turntable. He noted that such an observer would find a different value for the mathematical constant Ï€ than the one predicted by Euclidean geometry. <br>The reason is that the radius of a circle would be measured with an uncontracted ruler, but, according to special relativity, the circumference would seem to be longer because the ruler would be contracted. Since Einstein believed that the laws of physics were local, described by local fields, he concluded from this that spacetime could be locally curved. This led him to study Riemannian geometry, and to formulate general relativity in this language.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Developing general relativity</h2></b><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/particle.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/><p>Eddington''s photograph of a solar eclipse, which confirmed Einstein''s theory that light "bends".\r\nIn 1912, Einstein returned to Switzerland to accept a professorship at his alma mater, the ETH. Once back in Zurich, he immediately visited his old ETH classmate Marcel Grossmann, now a professor of mathematics, who introduced him to Riemannian geometry and, more generally, to differential geometry. On the recommendation of Italian mathematician Tullio Levi-Civita, <br>Einstein began exploring the usefulness of general covariance (essentially the use of tensors) for his gravitational theory. For a while Einstein thought that there were problems with the approach, but he later returned to it and, by late 1915, had published his general theory of relativity in the form in which it is used today. This theory explains gravitation as distortion of the structure of spacetime by matter, affecting the inertial motion of other matter. During World War I, the work of Central Powers scientists was available only to Central Powers academics, for national security reasons.<br> Some of Einstein''s work did reach the United Kingdom and the United States through the efforts of the Austrian Paul Ehrenfest and physicists in the Netherlands, especially 1902 Nobel Prize-winner Hendrik Lorentz and Willem de Sitter of Leiden University. After the war ended, Einstein maintained his relationship with Leiden University, accepting a contract as an Extraordinary Professor; for ten years, from 1920 to 1930, he travelled to Holland regularly to lecture.<br>\r\nIn 1917, several astronomers accepted Einstein ''s 1911 challenge from Prague. The Mount Wilson Observatory in California, U.S., published a solar spectroscopic analysis that showed no gravitational redshift. In 1918, the Lick Observatory, also in California, announced that it too had disproved Einstein''s prediction, although its findings were not published.<br>\r\nHowever, in May 1919, a team led by the British astronomer Arthur Stanley Eddington claimed to have confirmed Einstein''s prediction of gravitational deflection of starlight by the Sun while photographing a solar eclipse with dual expeditions in Sobral, northern Brazil, and PrÃ­ncipe, a west African island. Nobel laureate Max Born praised general relativity as the "greatest feat of human thinking about nature"; fellow laureate Paul Dirac was quoted saying it was "probably the greatest scientific discovery ever made". The international media guaranteed Einstein''s global renown.</p><br><p>\r\nThere have been claims that scrutiny of the specific photographs taken on the Eddington expedition showed the experimental uncertainty to be comparable to the same magnitude as the effect Eddington claimed to have demonstrated, and that a 1962 British expedition concluded that the method was inherently unreliable. The deflection of light during a solar eclipse was confirmed by later, more accurate observations.<br> Some resented the newcomer''s fame, notably among some German physicists, who later started the Deutsche Physik (German Physics) movement.</p><br>\r\n<h2>b<>General covariance and the hole argument</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>By 1912, Einstein was actively seeking a theory in which gravitation was explained as a geometric phenomenon. At the urging of Tullio Levi-Civita, Einstein began by exploring the use of general covariance (which is essentially the use of curvature tensors) to create a gravitational theory. However, in 1913 Einstein abandoned that approach, arguing that it is inconsistent based on the "hole argument". In 1914 and much of 1915, Einstein was trying to create field equations based on another approach. When that approach was proven to be inconsistent, Einstein revisited the concept of general covariance and discovered that the hole argument was flawed.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>The development of the Einstein field equations</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>When Einstein realized that general covariance was actually tenable, he quickly completed the development of the field equations that are named after him. However, he made a now-famous mistake. The field equations he published in October 1915 were<br>\r\nwhere is the Ricci tensor, and  the energy-momentum tensor. This predicted the non-Newtonianperihelion precession of Mercury, and so had Einstein very excited. However, it was soon realized that they were inconsistent with the local conservation of energy-momentum unless the universe had a constant density of mass-energy-momentum. In other words, air, rock and even a vacuum should all have the same density.<br> This inconsistency with observation sent Einstein back to the drawing board. However, the solution was all but obvious, and in November 1915 Einstein published the actual Einstein field equations:\r\n\r\nwhere is the Ricci scalar and  the metric tensor.<br> With the publication of the field equations, the issue became one of solving them for various cases and interpreting the solutions. This and experimental verification have dominated general relativity research ever since.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Einstein and Hilbert</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Although Einstein is credited with finding the field equations, the German mathematician David Hilbert published them in an article before Einstein''s article. This has resulted in accusations of plagiarism against Einstein (never from Hilbert), and assertions that the field equations should be called the "Einstein-Hilbert field equations". However, Hilbert did not press his claim for priority and somehave asserted that Einstein submitted the correct equations before Hilbert amended his own work to include them. <br>This suggests that Einstein developed the correct field equations first, though Hilbert may have reached them later independently (or even learned of them afterwards through his correspondence with Einstein). However, others have criticized those assertions.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Sir Arthur Eddington</h2></b><br>\r\n<;p>In the early years after Einstein''s theory was published, Sir Arthur Eddington lent his considerable prestige in the British scientific establishment in an effort to champion the work of this German scientist. Because the theory was so complex and abstruse (even today it is popularly considered the pinnacle of scientific thinking; in the early years it was even more so), it was rumored that only three people in the world understood it. There was an illuminating, <br>though probably apocryphal, anecdote about this. As related by Ludwik Silberstein, during one of Eddington''s lectures he asked "Professor Eddington, you must be one of three persons in the world who understands general relativity." Eddington paused, unable to answer. Silberstein continued "Don''t be modest, Eddington!" Finally, Eddington replied "On the contrary, I''m trying to think who the third person is."</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Solutions</h2></b><br>\r\n<b>The Schwarzschild solution</b>\r\n<p>Since the field equations are non-linear, Einstein assumed that they were unsolvable. However, in 1915 Karl Schwarzschild discovered an exact solution for the case of a spherically symmetric spacetime surrounding a massive object in spherical coordinates. This is now known as the Schwarzschild solution. Since then, many other exact solutions have been found.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>The expanding universe and the cosmological constant</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>In 1922, Alexander Friedmann found a solution in which the universe may expand or contract, and later Georges LemaÃ®tre derived a solution for an expanding universe. However, Einstein believed that the universe was apparently static, and since a static cosmology was not supported by the general relativistic field equations, he added a cosmological constant Î› to the field equations, which became<br>\r\nThis permitted the creation of steady-state solutions, but they were unstable: the slightest perturbation of a static state would result in the universe expanding or contracting. In 1929, Edwin Hubble found evidence for the idea that the universe is expanding. <br>This resulted in Einstein dropping the cosmological constant, referring to it as "the biggest blunder in my career". At the time, it was an ad hoc hypothesis to add in the cosmological constant, as it was only intended to justify one result (a static universe).</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>More exact solutions</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Progress in solving the field equations and understanding the solutions has been ongoing. The solution for a spherically symmetric charged object was discovered by Reissner and later rediscovered by NordstrÃ¶m, and is called the Reissner-NordstrÃ¶m solution. The black hole aspect of the Schwarzschild solution was very controversial, and Einstein did not believe that singularities could be real. However, in 1957 (two years after Einstein''s death in 1955), Martin Kruskal published a proof that black holes are called for by the Schwarzschild Solution. <br>Additionally, the solution for a rotating massive object was obtained by Kerr in the 1960s and is called the Kerr solution. The Kerr-Newman solution for a rotating, charged massive object was published a few years later.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Testing the theory</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>The perihelion precession of Mercury was the first evidence that general relativity is correct. Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington''s 1919 expedition in which he confirmed Einstein''s prediction for the deflection of light by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919 helped to cement the status of general relativity as a likely true theory. Since then many observations have confirmed the correctness of general relativity. These include studies of binary pulsars, observations of radio signals passing the limb of the Sun, and even the GPS system.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Alternative theories</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>There have been various attempts to find modifications to general relativity. The most famous of these are the Brans-Dicke theory (also known as scalar-tensor theory), and Rosen''s bimetric theory. Both of these theories proposed changes to the field equations of general relativity, and both suffer from these changes permitting the presence of bipolar gravitational radiation. As a result, Rosen''s original theory has been refuted by observations of binary pulsars. As for Brans-Dicke (which has a tunable parameter Ï‰ such that Ï‰ = âˆž is the same as general relativity), the amount by which it can differ from general relativity has been severely constrained by these observations.<br>\r\nIn addition, general relativity is inconsistent with quantum mechanics, the physical theory that describes the wave-particle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There is a great deal of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both general relativity and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>More about GR history</h2></b><br>\r\n	<p>This section may require cleanup to meet Wikipedia''s quality standards.

(7, 'The area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the mathematical method', 'History of mathematics', '<p>A proof from Euclid''sElements, widely considered the most influential textbook of all time. \r\nThe area of study known as the history of mathematics is primarily an investigation into the origin of discoveries in mathematics and, to a lesser extent, an investigation into the mathematical methods and notation of the past.\r\nBefore the modern age and the worldwide spread of knowledge, written examples of new mathematical developments have come to light only in a few locales. The most ancient mathematical texts available are Plimpton 322 (Babylonian mathematics c. 1900 BC), the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian mathematics c. 2000-1800 BC) and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus (Egyptian mathematics c. 1890 BC). All of these texts concern the so-called Pythagorean theorem, which seems to be the most ancient and widespread mathematical development after basic arithmetic and geometry.<br>\r\nThe study of mathematics as a subject in its own right begins in the 6th century BC with the Pythagoreans, who coined the term "mathematics" from the ancient Greek Î¼Î¬Î¸Î·Î¼Î± (mathema), meaning "subject of instruction".[4]Greek mathematics greatly refined the methods (especially through the introduction of deductive reasoning and mathematical rigor in proofs) and expanded the subject matter of mathematics.[5]Chinese mathematics made early contributions, including a place value system.[6][7] The Hindu-Arabic numeral system and the rules for the use of its operations, in use throughout the world today, likely evolved over the course of the first millennium AD in India and was transmitted to the west via Islamic mathematics.<br> Islamic mathematics, in turn, developed and expanded the mathematics known to these civilizations.[10] Many Greek and Arabic texts on mathematics were then translated into Latin, which led to further development of mathematics in medieval Europe.\r\nFrom ancient times through the Middle Ages, bursts of mathematical creativity were often followed by centuries of stagnation. Beginning in RenaissanceItaly in the 16th century, new mathematical developments, interacting with new scientific discoveries, were made at an increasing pace that continues through the present day.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Prehistoric mathematics</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>The origin of mathematical thought lie in the concepts of number, magnitude, and form. Modern studies of animal cognition have shown that these concepts are not unique to humans. Such concepts would have been part of everyday life in hunter-gatherer societies. The idea of the "number" concept evolving gradually over time is supported by the existence of languages which preserve the distinction between "one", "two", and "many", but not of numbers larger than two.<br> \r\nThe oldest known possibly mathematical object is the Lebombo bone, discovered in the Lebombomountains of Swaziland and dated to approximately 35,000 BC. It consists of 29 distinct notches cut into a baboon''s fibula. Also prehistoricartifacts discovered in Africa and France, dated between 35,000 and 20,000 years old, suggest early attempts to quantify time. \r\nThe Ishango bone, found near the headwaters of the Nile river (northeastern Congo), may be as much as 20,000 years old and consists of a series of tally marks carved in three columns running the length of the bone. Common interpretations are that the Ishango bone shows either the earliest known demonstration of sequences of prime numbers or a six-month lunar calendar.<br>[  In the book How Mathematics Happened: The First 50,000 Years, Peter Rudman argues that the development of the concept of prime numbers could only have come about after the concept of division, which he dates to after 10,000 BC, with prime numbers probably not being understood until about 500 BC. He also writes that "no attempt has been made to explain why a tally of something should exhibit multiples of two, prime numbers between 10 and 20, and some numbers that are almost multiples of 10." The Ishango bone, according to scholar Alexander Marshack, may have influenced the later development of mathematics in Egypt as, like some entries on the Ishango bone, Egyptian arithmetic also made use of multiplication by 2; this, however, is disputed.<br> \r\nPredynastic Egyptians of the 5th millennium BC pictorially represented geometric designs. It has been claimed that megalithic monuments in England and Scotland, dating from the 3rd millennium BC, incorporate geometric ideas such as circles, ellipses, and Pythagorean triples in their design. \r\nAll of the above are disputed however, and the currently oldest undisputed mathematical usage is in Babylonian and dynastic Egyptian sources. Thus it took human beings at least 45,000 years from the attainment of behavioral modernity and language (generally thought to be a long time before that) to develop mathematics as such.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Babylonian mathematics</h2></b><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/bablon.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<p>The Babylonian mathematical tablet Plimpton 322, dated to 1800 BC.\r\nBabylonian mathematics refers to any mathematics of the people of Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) from the days of the early Sumerians through the Hellenistic period almost to the dawn of Christianity.[20] It is named Babylonian mathematics due to the central role of Babylon as a place of study. Later under the Arab Empire, Mesopotamia, especially Baghdad, once again became an important center of study for Islamic mathematics.<br>\r\nIn contrast to the sparsity of sources in Egyptian mathematics, our knowledge of Babylonian mathematics is derived from more than 400 clay tablets unearthed since the 1850s. Written in Cuneiform script, tablets were inscribed whilst the clay was moist, and baked hard in an oven or by the heat of the sun. Some of these appear to be graded homework.\r\nThe earliest evidence of written mathematics dates back to the ancient Sumerians, who built the earliest civilization in Mesopotamia. They developed a complex system of metrology from 3000 BC. From around 2500 BC onwards, the Sumerians wrote multiplication tables on clay tablets and dealt with geometrical exercises and division problems. The earliest traces of the Babylonian numerals also date back to this period.<br> \r\nThe majority of recovered clay tablets date from 1800 to 1600 BC, and cover topics which include fractions, algebra, quadratic and cubic equations, and the calculation of regularreciprocalpairs.<br> The tablets also include multiplication tables and methods for solving linear and quadratic equations. The Babylonian tablet YBC 7289 gives an approximation of âˆš2 accurate to five decimal places.\r\nBabylonian mathematics were written using a sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system. From this derives the modern day usage of 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, and 360 (60 x 6) degrees in a circle, as well as the use of seconds and minutes of arc to denote fractions of a degree. Babylonian advances in mathematics were facilitated by the fact that 60 has many divisors. Also, unlike the Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values, much as in the decimal system. <br>They lacked, however, an equivalent of the decimal point, and so the place value of a symbol often had to be inferred from the context. On the other hand, this "defect" is equivalent to the modern-day usage of floating point arithmetic; moreover, the use of base 60 means that any reciprocal of an integer which is a multiple of divisors of 60 necessarily has a finite expansion to the base 60. (In decimal arithmetic, only reciprocals of multiples of 2 and 5 have finite decimal expansions.) Accordingly, there is a strong argument that arithmetic Old Babylonian style is considerably more sophisticated than that of current usage.</p><br><p>\r\nThe interpretation of Plimpton 322 was the source of controversy for many years after its significance in the context of Pythagorean triangles was realized. In historical context, inheritance problems involving equal-area subdivision of triangular and trapezoidal fields (with integer length sides) quickly convert into the need to calculate the square root of 2, or to solve the "Pythagorean equation" in integers.<br>\r\nRather than considering a square as the sum of two squares, we can equivalently consider a square as a difference of two squares. Let a, b and c be integers that form a Pythagorean Triple: a^2 + b^2 = c^2. Then c^2 - a^2 = b^2, and using the expansion for the difference of two squares we get (c-a)(c+a)= b^2. Dividing by b^2, it becomes the product of two rational numbers giving 1: (c/b - a/b)(c/b + a/b) = 1. We require two rational numbers which are reciprocals and which differ by 2(a/b). This is easily solved by consulting a table of reciprocal pairs. E.g., (1/2) (2) = 1 is a pair of reciprocals which differ by 3/2 = 2(a/b) Thus a/b = 3/4, giving a=3, b=4 and so c=5.<br>\r\nSolutions of the original equation are thus constructed by choosing a rational number x, from which Pythagorean-triples are 2x, x^2-1, x^2+1. Other triples are made by scaling these by an integer (the scaling integer being half the difference between the largest and one other side). All Pythagorean triples arise in this way ???, and the examples provided in Plimpton 322 involve some quite large numbers, by modern standards, such as (4601, 4800, 6649) in decimal notation.</p><br>\r\nEgyptian mathematics\r\nMain article: Egyptian mathematics\r\n<center><img src="logo/egypt.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<p>Image of Problem 14 from the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus.

From the Hellenistic period, Greek replaced Egyptian as the written language of Egyptian scholars. Mathematical study in Egypt later continued under the Arab Empire as part of Islamic mathematics, when Arabic became the written language of Egyptian scholars.<br>\r\nThe most extensive Egyptian mathematical text is the Rhind papyrus (sometimes also called the Ahmes Papyrus after its author), dated to c. 1650 BC but likely a copy of an older document from the Middle Kingdom of about 2000-1800 BC. It is an instruction manual for students in arithmetic and geometry. In addition to giving area formulas and methods for multiplication, division and working with unit fractions, it also contains evidence of other mathematical knowledge,[25] including composite and prime numbers; arithmetic, geometric and harmonic means; and simplistic understandings of both the Sieve of Eratosthenes and perfect number theory (namely, that of the number 6). It also shows how to solve first order linear equations as well as arithmetic and geometric series. <br>\r\nAnother significant Egyptian mathematical text is the Moscow papyrus, also from the Middle Kingdom period, dated to c. 1890 BC. It consists of what are today called word problems or story problems, which were apparently intended as entertainment. One problem is considered to be of particular importance because it gives a method for finding the volume of a frustum: "If you are told: A truncated pyramid of 6 for the vertical height by 4 on the base by 2 on the top. You are to square this 4, result 16. You are to double 4, result 8. You are to square 2, result 4. You are to add the 16, the 8, and the 4, result 28. You are to take one third of 6, result 2. You are to take 28 twice, result 56. See, it is 56. You will find it right."<br>\r\nFinally, the Berlin papyrus (c. 1300 BC) shows that ancient Egyptians could solve a second-order algebraic equation. </p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Greek mathematics</h2></b><br>\r\nMain article: Greek mathematics\r\n<center><img src="logo/greek.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<p>The Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagoreans are generally credited with the first proof of the theorem.\r\nGreek mathematics refers to the mathematics written in the Greek language from the time of Thales of Miletus (~600 BC) to the closure of the Academy of Athens in 529 AD. Greek mathematicians lived in cities spread over the entire Eastern Mediterranean, from Italy to North Africa, but were united by culture and language. Greek mathematics of the period following Alexander the Great is sometimes called Hellenistic mathematics.<br> \r\nGreek mathematics was much more sophisticated than the mathematics that had been developed by earlier cultures. All surviving records of pre-Greek mathematics show the use of inductive reasoning, that is, repeated observations used to establish rules of thumb. Greek mathematicians, by contrast, used deductive reasoning. The Greeks used logic to derive conclusions from definitions and axioms, and used mathematical rigor to prove them.<br> \r\nGreek mathematics is thought to have begun with Thales of Miletus (c. 624â€“c.546 BC) and Pythagoras of Samos (c. 582â€“c. 507 BC). Although the extent of the influence is disputed, they were probably inspired by Egyptian and Babylonian mathematics. According to legend, Pythagoras traveled to Egypt to learn mathematics, geometry, and astronomy from Egyptian priests.<br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f1.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\nOne of the oldest surviving fragments of Euclid''s Elements, found at Oxyrhynchus and dated to circa AD 100. The diagram accompanies Book II, Proposition 5.<br> \r\nThales used geometry to solve problems such as calculating the height of pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. He is credited with the first use of deductive reasoning applied to geometry, by deriving four corollaries to Thales'' Theorem. As a result, he has been hailed as the first true mathematician and the first known individual to whom a mathematical discovery has been attributed. Pythagoras established the Pythagorean School, whose doctrine it was that mathematics ruled the universe and whose motto was "All is number".<br> It was the Pythagoreans who coined the term "mathematics", and with whom the study of mathematics for its own sake begins. The Pythagoreans are credited with the first proof of the Pythagorean theorem, though the statement of the theorem has a long history, and with the proof of the existence of irrational numbers. <br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f2.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n<b>Archimedes used the method of exhaustion to approximate the value of pi.</b><br>\r\n<p>Plato (428/427 BC â€“ 348/347 BC) is important in the history of mathematics for inspiring and guiding others. His Platonic Academy, in Athens, became the mathematical center of the world in the 4th century BC, and it was from this school that the leading mathematicians of the day, such as Eudoxus of Cnidus, came. Plato also discussed the foundations of mathematics, clarified some of the definitions (e.g. that of a line as "breadthless length"), and reorganized the assumptions. The analytic method is ascribed to Plato, while a formula for obtaining Pythagorean triples bears his name. <br>\r\nEudoxus (408â€“c.355 BC) developed the method of exhaustion, a precursor of modern integration and a theory of ratios that avoided the problem of incommensurable magnitudes. The former allowed the calculations of areas and volumes of curvilinear figures, while the latter enabled subsequent geometers to make significant advances in geometry. Though he made no specific technical mathematical discoveries, Aristotle (384â€”c.322 BC) contributed significantly to the development of mathematics by laying the foundations of logic.<br> \r\nIn the 3rd century BC, the premier center of mathematical education and research was the Musaeum of Alexandria. It was there that Euclid (c. 300 BC) taught, and wrote the Elements, widely considered the most successful and influential textbook of all time. The Elements introduced mathematical rigor through the axiomatic method and is the earliest example of the format still used in mathematics today, that of definition, axiom, theorem, and proof. Although most of the contents of the Elements were already known, Euclid arranged them into a single, coherent logical framework. The Elements was known to all educated people in the West until the middle of the 20th century and its contents are still taught in geometry classes today.<br> In addition to the familiar theorems of Euclidean geometry, the Elements was meant as an introductory textbook to all mathematical subjects of the time, such as number theory, algebra and solid geometry,[49] including proofs that the square root of two is irrational and that there are infinitely many prime numbers. Euclid also wrote extensively on other subjects, such as conic sections, optics, spherical geometry, and mechanics, but only half of his writings survive. <br>\r\nThe first woman mathematician recorded by history was Hypatia of Alexandria (AD 350 - 415). She succeeded her father as Librarian at the Great Library and wrote many works on applied mathematics. Because of a political dispute, the Christian community in Alexandria punished her, presuming she was involved, by stripping her naked and scraping off her skin with clamshells (some say roofing tiles).<b>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f3.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p>Apollonius of Perga made significant advances in the study of conic sections.\r\nArchimedes (c.287â€“212 BC) of Syracuse, widely considered the greatest mathematician of antiquity, used the method of exhaustion to calculate the area under the arc of a parabola with the summation of an infinite series, in a manner not too dissimilar from modern calculus. He also showed one could use the method of exhaustion to calculate the value of Ï€ with as much precision as desired, and obtained the most accurate value of Ï€ then known, 310â„71 < Ï€ < 310â„70.<br> He also studied the spiral bearing his name, obtained formulas for the volumes of surfaces of revolution (paraboloid, ellipsoid, hyperboloid), and an ingenious system for expressing very large numbers While he is also known for his contributions to physics and several advanced mechanical devices, Archimedes himself placed far greater value on the products of his thought and general mathematical principles. He regarded as his greatest achievement his finding of the surface area and volume of a sphere, which he obtained by proving these are 2/3 the surface area and volume a cylinder circumscribing the sphere.</p><br> \r\n<p>Apollonius of Perga (c. 262-190 BC) made significant advances to the study of conic sections, showing that one can obtain all three varieties of conic section by varying the angle of the plane that cuts a double-napped cone. He also coined the terminology in use today for conic sections, namely parabola ("place beside" or "comparison"), "ellipse" ("deficiency"), and "hyperbola" ("a throw beyond"). His work Conics is one of the best known and preserved mathematical works from antiquity, and in it he derives many theorems concerning conic<br> sections that would prove invaluable to later mathematicians and astronomers studying planetary motion, such as Isaac Newton. While neither Apollonius nor any other Greek mathematicians made the leap to coordinate geometry, Apollonius'' treatment of curves is in some ways similar to the modern treatment, and some of his work seems to anticipate the development of analytical geometry by Descartes some 1800 years later.<br> \r\nAround the same time, Eratosthenes of Cyrene (c. 276-194 BC) devised the Sieve of Eratosthenes for finding prime numbers. The 3rd century BC is generally regarded as the "Golden Age" of Greek mathematics, with advances in pure mathematics henceforth in relative decline. Nevertheless, in the centuries that followed significant advances were made in applied mathematics, most notably trigonometry, largely to address the needs of astronomers.<br> Hipparchus of Nicaea (c. 190-120 BC) is considered the founder of trigonometry for compiling the first known trigonometric table, and to him is also due the systematic use of the 360 degree circle.[65]Heron of Alexandria (c. 10â€“70 AD) is credited with Heron''s formula for finding the area of a scalene triangle and with being the first to recognize the possibility of negative numbers possessing square roots.</p><br><p> Menelaus of Alexandria (c. 100 AD) pioneered spherical trigonometry through Menelaus'' theorem.[67] The most complete and influential trigonometric work of antiquity is the Almagest of Ptolemy (c. AD 90-168), a landmark astronomical treatise whose trigonometric tables would be used by astronomers for the next thousand years. Ptolemy is also credited with Ptolemy''s theorem for deriving trigonometric quantities, and the most accurate value of Ï€ outside of China until the medieval period, 3.1416.<br> \r\nFollowing a period of stagnation after Ptolemy, the period between 250 and 350 AD is sometimes referred to as the "Silver Age" of Greek mathematics. During this period, Diophantus made significant advances in algebra, particularly indeterminate analysis, which is also known as "Diophantine analysis". The study of Diophantine equations and Diophantine approximations is a significant area of research to this day. His main work was the Arithmetica, a collection of 150 algebraic problems dealing with exact solutions to determinate and indeterminate equations.<br> The Arithmetica had a significant influence on later mathematicians, such as Pierre de Fermat, who arrived at his famous Last Theorem after trying to generalize a problem he had read in the Arithmetica (that of dividing a square into two squares). Diophantus also made significant advances in notation, the Arithmetica being the first instance of algebraic symbolism and syncopation.</p><br> \r\n<h2><b>Chinese mathematics</h2></b><br>\r\nMain article: Chinese mathematics\r\n<center><img src="logo/f4.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\nCounting rod numerals\r\n<br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f5.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br>\r\nThe Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, one of the earliest surviving mathematical texts from China (2nd century AD).<br>\r\n<p>Early Chinese mathematics is so different from that of other parts of the world that it is reasonable to assume independent development. The oldest extant mathematical text from China is the Chou Pei SuanChing, variously dated to between 1200 BC and 100 BC, though a date of about 300 BC appears reasonable. <br>\r\nOf particular note is the use in Chinese mathematics of a decimal positional notation system, the so-called "rod numerals" in which distinct ciphers were used for numbers between 1 and 10, and additional ciphers for powers of ten.  Thus, the number 123 would be written using the symbol for "1", followed by the symbol for "100", then the symbol for "2" followed by the symbol for "10", followed by the symbol for "3". This was the most advanced number system in the world at the time, apparently in use several centuries before the common era and well before the development of the Indian numeral system.<br> Rod numerals allowed the representation of numbers as large as desired and allowed calculations to be carried out on the suan pan, or Chinese abacus. The date of the invention of the suan pan is not certain, but the earliest written mention dates from AD 190, in XuYue''sSupplementary Notes on the Art of Figures.\r\nThe oldest existent work on geometry in China comes from the philosophical Mohist canon c. 330 BC, compiled by the followers of Mozi (470â€“390 BC). The Mo Jing described various aspects of many fields associated with physical science, and provided a small number of geometrical theorems as well.</p><br> \r\n<p>In 212 BC, the Emperor Qin Shi Huang (Shi Huang-ti) commanded all books in the Qin Empire other than officially sanctioned ones be burned. This decree was not universally obeyed, but as a consequence of this order little is known about ancient Chinese mathematics before this date. After the book burning of 212 BC, the Han dynasty (202 BCâ€“220 AD) produced works of mathematics which presumably expanded on works that are now lost. The most important of these is The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, the full title of which appeared by AD 179, but existed in part under other titles beforehand.<br> It consists of 246 word problems involving agriculture, business, employment of geometry to figure height spans and dimension ratios for Chinese pagoda towers, engineering, surveying, and includes material on right triangles and values of Ï€.[75] It created mathematical proof for the Pythagorean theorem, and a mathematical formula for Gaussian elimination. Liu Hui commented on the work in the 3rd century AD, and gave a value of Ï€ accurate to 5 decimal places. Though more of a matter of computational stamina than theoretical insight, in the 5th century AD ZuChongzhi computed the value of Ï€ to seven decimal places, which remained the most accurate value of Ï€ for almost the next 1000 years.<br>He also established a method which would later be called Cavalieri''s principle to find the volume of a sphere.</p><br><br> \r\n<p>The high-water mark of Chinese mathematics occurs in the 13th century (latter part of the Sung period), with the development of Chinese algebra. The most important text from that period is the Precious Mirror of the Four Elements by Chu Shih-chieh (fl. 1280-1303), dealing with the solution of simultaneous higher order algebraic equations using a method similar to Horner''s method. The Precious Mirror also contains a diagram of Pascal''s triangle with coefficients of binomial expansions through the eighth power, though both appear in Chinese works as early as 1100.<br> The Chinese also made use of the complex combinatorial diagram known as the magic square and magic circles, described in ancient times and perfected by Yang Hui (AD 1238â€“1298). \r\nEven after European mathematics began to flourish during the Renaissance, European and Chinese mathematics were separate traditions, with significant Chinese mathematical output in decline from the 13th century onwards.<br> Jesuit missionaries such as Matteo Ricci carried mathematical ideas back and forth between the two cultures from the 16th to 18th centuries, though at this point far more mathematical ideas were entering China than leaving.</p><br> \r\n<h2><b>Indian mathematics</h2></b><br>Main article: Indian mathematics<br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f6.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\nThe numerals used in the Bakhshali manuscript, dated between the 2nd century BCE and the 2nd century CE.<br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f7.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<b>Brahmi numerals (lower row) in India in the 1st century CE</b><br>\r\n<p>The earliest civilization on the Indian subcontinent is the Indus Valley Civilization that flourished between 2600 and 1900 BC in the Indus river basin. Their cities were laid out with geometric regularity, but no known mathematical documents survive from this civilization. \r\nThe oldest extant mathematical records from India are the Sulba Sutras (dated variously between the 8th century BC and the 2nd century AD), appendices to religious texts which give simple rules for constructing altars of various shapes, such as squares, rectangles, parallelograms, and others.<br> As with Egypt, the preoccupation with temple functions points to an origin of mathematics in religious ritual. The Sulba Sutras give methods for constructing a circle with approximately the same area as a given square, which imply several different approximations of the value of Ï€. In addition, they compute the square root of 2 to several decimal places, list Pythagorean triples, and give a statement of the Pythagorean theorem. All of these results are present in Babylonian mathematics, indicating Mesopotamian influence. It is not known to what extent the Sulba Sutras influenced later Indian mathematicians. As in China, there is a lack of continuity in Indian mathematics; significant advances are separated by long periods of inactivity.</p><br> <p>\r\nPÄá¹‡ini (c. 5th century BC) formulated the rules for Sanskrit grammar.[88] His notation was similar to modern mathematical notation, and used metarules, transformations, and recursion. Pingala (roughly 3rd-1st centuries BC) in his treatise of prosody uses a device corresponding to a binary numeral system. His discussion of the combinatorics of meters corresponds to an elementary version of the binomial theorem. Pingala''s work also contains the basic ideas of Fibonacci numbers (called mÄtrÄmeru).<br> \r\nThe next significant mathematical documents from India after the Sulba Sutras are the Siddhantas, astronomical treatises from the 4th and 5th centuries AD (Gupta period) showing strong Hellenistic influence. They are significant in that they contain the first instance of trigonometric relations based on the half-chord, as is the case in modern trigonometry, rather than the full chord, as was the case in Ptolemaic trigonometry. Through a series of translation errors, the words "sine" and "cosine" derive from the Sanskrit "jiya" and "kojiya".<br>\r\nIn the 5th century AD, Aryabhata wrote the Aryabhatiya, a slim volume, written in verse, intended to supplement the rules of calculation used in astronomy and mathematical mensuration, though with no feeling for logic or deductive methodology.  Though about half of the entries are wrong, it is in the Aryabhatiya that the decimal place-value system first appears. Several centuries later, the Muslim mathematicianAbu RayhanBiruni described the Aryabhatiya as a "mix of common pebbles and costly crystals".<br>\r\nIn the 7th century, Brahmagupta identified the Brahmagupta theorem, Brahmagupta''s identity and Brahmagupta''s formula, and for the first time, in Brahma-sphuta-siddhanta, he lucidly explained the use of zero as both a placeholder and decimal digit, and explained the Hindu-Arabic numeral system. It was from a translation of this Indian text on mathematics (c. 770) that Islamic mathematicians were introduced to this numeral system, which they adapted as Arabic numerals. Islamic scholars carried knowledge of this number system to Europe by the 12th century, and it has now displaced all older number systems throughout the world.</p><br><p> In the 10th century, Halayudha''s commentary on Pingala''s work contains a study of the Fibonacci sequence and Pascal''s triangle, and describes the formation of a matrix.\r\nIn the 12th century, BhÄskaraII lived in southern India and wrote extensively on all then known branches of mathematics. His work contains mathematical objects equivalent or approximately equivalent to infinitesimals, derivatives, the mean value theorem and the derivative of the sine function. To what extent he anticipated the invention of calculus is a controversial subject among historians of mathematics.<br> \r\n<center><img src="logo/f8.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Explanation of the sine rule in YuktibhÄá¹£Ä</b><br>\r\n<p>In the 14th century, Madhava of Sangamagrama, the founder of the so-called Kerala School of Mathematics, found the Madhavaâ€“Leibniz series, and, using 21 terms, computed the value of Ï€ as 3.14159265359. Madhava also found the Madhava-Gregory series to determine the arctangent, the Madhava-Newton power series to determine sine and cosine and the Taylor approximation for sine and cosine functions. In the 16th century, Jyesthadeva consolidated many of the Kerala School''s developments and theorems in the Yukti-bhÄá¹£Ä. However, the Kerala School did not formulate a systematic theory of differentiation and integration, nor is there any direct evidence of their results being transmitted outside Kerala.

Although most Islamic texts on mathematics were written in Arabic, most of them were not written by Arabs, since much like the status of Greek in the Hellenistic world, Arabic was used as the written language of non-Arab scholars throughout the Islamic world at the time. Persians contributed to the world of Mathematics alongside Arabs.<br>\r\nIn the 9th century, the Persian mathematician Muá¸¥ammadibnMÅ«sÄ al-KhwÄrizmÄ« wrote several important books on the Hindu-Arabic numerals and on methods for solving equations. His book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals, written about 825, along with the work of Al-Kindi, were instrumental in spreading Indian mathematics and Indian numerals to the West. The word algorithm is derived from the Latinization of his name, Algoritmi, and the word algebra from the title of one of his works, Al-KitÄb al-mukhtaá¹£arfÄ«hÄ«sÄb al-ÄŸabrwaâ€™l-muqÄbala (The Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing). He gave an exhaustive explanation for the algebraic solution of quadratic equations with positive roots.<br> and he was the first to teach algebra in an elementary form and for its own sake. He also discussed the fundamental method of "reduction" and "balancing", referring to the transposition of subtracted terms to the other side of an equation, that is, the cancellation of like terms on opposite sides of the equation. This is the operation which al-KhwÄrizmÄ« originally described as al-jabr. His algebra was also no longer concerned "with a series of problems to be resolved, but an exposition which starts with primitive terms in which the combinations must give all possible prototypes for equations, which henceforward explicitly constitute the true object of study."<br> He also studied an equation for its own sake and "in a generic manner, insofar as it does not simply emerge in the course of solving a problem, but is specifically called on to define an infinite class of problems." \r\nFurther developments in algebra were made by Al-Karaji in his treatise al-Fakhri, where he extends the methodology to incorporate integer powers and integer roots of unknown quantities. Something close to a proof by mathematical induction appears in a book written by Al-Karaji around 1000 AD, who used it to prove the binomial theorem, Pascal''s triangle, and the sum of integralcubes. The historian of mathematics, F. Woepcke, praised Al-Karaji for being "the first who introduced the theory of algebraiccalculus."<br> Also in the 10th century, AbulWafa translated the works of Diophantus into Arabic. Ibn al-Haytham was the first mathematician to derive the formula for the sum of the fourth powers, using a method that is readily generalizable for determining the general formula for the sum of any integral powers. He performed an integration in order to find the volume of a paraboloid, and was able to generalize his result for the integrals of polynomials up to the fourth degree. He thus came close to finding a general formula for the integrals of polynomials, but he was not concerned with any polynomials higher than the fourth degree.</p><br><p> \r\nIn the late 11th century, Omar Khayyam wrote Discussions of the Difficulties in Euclid, a book about what he perceived as flaws in Euclid''s Elements, especially the parallel postulate. He was also the first to find the general geometric solution to cubic equations. He was also very influential in calendar reform. In the 13th century, Nasir al-Din Tusi (Nasireddin) made advances in spherical trigonometry. He also wrote influential work on Euclid''s parallel postulate. In the 15th century, Ghiyath al-Kashi computed the value of Ï€ to the 16th decimal place. Kashi also had an algorithm for calculating nth roots, which was a special case of the methods given many centuries later by Ruffini and Horner.<br>\r\nOther achievements of Muslim mathematicians during this period include the addition of the decimal point notation to the Arabic numerals, the discovery of all the modern trigonometric functions besides the sine, al-Kindi''s introduction of cryptanalysis and frequency analysis, the development of analytic geometry by Ibn al-Haytham, the beginning of algebraic geometry by Omar Khayyam and the development of an algebraic notation by al-QalasÄdÄ«. \r\nDuring the time of the Ottoman Empire and Safavid Empire from the 15th century, the development of Islamic mathematics became stagnant.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>Medieval European mathematics</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Medieval European interest in mathematics was driven by concerns quite different from those of modern mathematicians. One driving element was the belief that mathematics provided the key to understanding the created order of nature, frequently justified by Plato''s Timaeus and the biblical passage (in the Book of Wisdom) that God had ordered all things in measure, and number, and weight.<br> \r\nBoethius provided a place for mathematics in the curriculum in the 6th century when he coined the term quadrivium to describe the study of arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, and music. He wrote De institutionearithmetica, a free translation from the Greek of Nicomachus''sIntroduction to Arithmetic; De institutionemusica, also derived from Greek sources; and a series of excerpts from Euclid''s Elements. His works were theoretical, rather than practical, and were the basis of mathematical study until the recovery of Greek and Arabic mathematical works.<br> \r\nIn the 12th century, European scholars traveled to Spain and Sicily seeking scientific Arabic texts, including al-KhwÄrizmÄ«''sThe Compendious Book on Calculation by Completion and Balancing, translated into Latin by Robert of Chester, and the complete text of Euclid''s Elements, translated in various versions by Adelard of Bath, Herman of Carinthia, and Gerard of Cremona. <br>\r\nThese new sources sparked a renewal of mathematics. Fibonacci, writing in the Liber Abaci, in 1202 and updated in 1254, produced the first significant mathematics in Europe since the time of Eratosthenes, a gap of more than a thousand years. The work introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals to Europe, and discussed many other mathematical problems.\r\nThe 14th century saw the development of new mathematical concepts to investigate a wide range of problems. One important contribution was development of mathematics of local motion.<br>\r\nThomas Bradwardine proposed that speed (V) increases in arithmetic proportion as the ratio of force (F) to resistance (R) increases in geometric proportion. Bradwardine expressed this by a series of specific examples, but although the logarithm had not yet been conceived, we can express his conclusion anachronistically by writing: V = log (F/R). Bradwardine''s analysis is an example of transferring a mathematical technique used by al-Kindi and Arnald of Villanova to quantify the nature of compound medicines to a different physical problem.<br> \r\nOne of the 14th-century Oxford Calculators, William Heytesbury, lacking differential calculus and the concept of limits, proposed to measure instantaneous speed "by the path that would be described by [a body] if... it were moved uniformly at the same degree of speed with which it is moved in that given instant".</p><br><p>\r\nHeytesbury and others mathematically determined the distance covered by a body undergoing uniformly accelerated motion (today solved by integration), stating that "a moving body uniformly acquiring or losing that increment [of speed] will traverse in some given time a [distance] completely equal to that which it would traverse if it were moving continuously through the same time with the mean degree [of speed]".<br> \r\nNicole Oresme at the University of Paris and the Italian Giovanni di Casali independently provided graphical demonstrations of this relationship, asserting that the area under the line depicting the constant acceleration, represented the total distance traveled. In a later mathematical commentary on Euclid''s Elements, Oresme made a more detailed general analysis in which he demonstrated that a body will acquire in each successive increment of time an increment of any quality that increases as the odd numbers. Since Euclid had demonstrated the sum of the odd numbers are the square numbers, the total quality acquired by the body increases as the square of the time.</p><br> \r\n<h2><b>Renaissance mathematics</h2></b><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f9.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<br>\r\n<b>Portrait of Luca Pacioli, a painting traditionally attributed to Jacopo de'' Barbari, 1495, (Museo di Capodimonte).<b><br>\r\n<p>During the Renaissance, the development of mathematics and of accounting were intertwined. While there is no direct relationship between algebra and accounting, the teaching of the subjects and the books published often intended for the children of merchants who were sent to reckoning schools (in Flanders and Germany) or abacus schools (known as abbaco in Italy), where they learned the skills useful for trade and commerce.<br> There is probably no need for algebra in performing bookkeeping operations, but for complex bartering operations or the calculation of compound interest, a basic knowledge of arithmetic was mandatory and knowledge of algebra was very useful.\r\nLuca Pacioli''s"Summa de Arithmetica, Geometria, Proportioni et ProportionalitÃ " (Italian: "Review of Arithmetic, Geometry, Ratio and Proportion") was first printed and published in Venice in 1494. It included a 27-page treatise on bookkeeping, "Particularis de Computis et Scripturis" (Italian: "Details of Calculation and Recording").<br> It was written primarily for, and sold mainly to, merchants who used the book as a reference text, as a source of pleasure from the mathematical puzzles it contained, and to aid the education of their sons.  In Summa Arithmetica, Pacioli introduced symbols for plus and minus for the first time in a printed book, symbols that became standard notation in Italian Renaissance mathematics. Summa Arithmetica was also the first known book printed in Italy to contain algebra. It is important to note that Pacioli himself had borrowed much of the work of Piero Della Francesca whom he plagiarized.</p><br><p>\r\nIn Italy, during the first half of the 16th century, Scipionedel Ferro and NiccolÃ² Fontana Tartaglia discovered solutions for cubic equations. GerolamoCardano published them in his 1545 book Ars Magna, together with a solution for the quartic equations, discovered by his student Lodovico Ferrari. In 1572 Rafael Bombelli published his L''Algebra in which he showed how to deal with the imaginary quantities that could appear in Cardano''s formula for solving cubic equations.<br>\r\nSimon Stevin''s book De Thiende (''the art of tenths''), first published in Dutch in 1585, contained the first systematic treatment of decimal notation, which influenced all later work on the real number system.\r\nDriven by the demands of navigation and the growing need for accurate maps of large areas, trigonometry grew to be a major branch of mathematics. BartholomaeusPitiscus was the first to use the word, publishing his Trigonometria in 1595. Regiomontanus''s table of sines and cosines was published in 1533.<br> \r\nDuring the Renaissance the desire of artists to represent the natural world realistically, together with the rediscovered philosophy of the Greeks, led artists to study mathematics. They were also the engineers and architects of that time, and so had need of mathematics in any case. The art of painting in perspective, and the developments in geometry that involved, were studied intensely.</p><br>\r\nMathematics during the Scientific Revolution\r\n17th century\r\n<center><img src="logo/f10.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.\r\nThe 17th century saw an unprecedented explosion of mathematical and scientific ideas across Europe. Galileo observed the moons of Jupiter in orbit about that planet, using a telescope based on a toy imported from Holland. Tycho Brahe had gathered an enormous quantity of mathematical data describing the positions of the planets in the sky. Through his position as Brahe''s assistant, Johannes Kepler was first exposed to and seriously interacted with the topic of planetary motion. Kepler''s calculations were made simpler by the contemporaneous invention of logarithms by John Napier and JostBÃ¼rgi. Kepler succeeded in formulating mathematical laws of planetary motion.[131]Theanalytic geometry developed by RenÃ© Descartes (1596â€“1650) allowed those orbits to be plotted on a graph, in Cartesian coordinates. Simon Stevin (1585) created the basis for modern decimal notation capable of describing all numbers, whether rational or irrational.\r\nBuilding on earlier work by many predecessors, Isaac Newton discovered the laws of physics explaining Kepler''s Laws, and brought together the concepts now known as infinitesimal calculus. Independently, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who is arguably one of the most important mathematicians of the 17th century, developed calculus and much of the calculus notation still in use today. Science and mathematics had become an international endeavor, which would soon spread over the entire world.[132]\r\nIn addition to the application of mathematics to the studies of the heavens, applied mathematics began to expand into new areas, with the correspondence of Pierre de Fermat and Blaise Pascal. Pascal and Fermat set the groundwork for the investigations of probability theory and the corresponding rules of combinatorics in their discussions over a game of gambling. Pascal, with his wager, attempted to use the newly developing probability theory to argue for a life devoted to religion, on the grounds that even if the probability of success was small, the rewards were infinite. In some sense, this foreshadowed the development of utility theory in the 18thâ€“19th century.\r\n<center><img src="logo/f11.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n18th century<br/>\r\nLeonhard Euler by Emanuel Handmann.\r\nThe most influential mathematician of the 18th century was arguably Leonhard Euler. His contributions range from founding the study of graph theory with the Seven Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg problem to standardizing many modern mathematical terms and notations. For example, he named the square root of minus 1 with the symbol i, and he popularized the use of the Greek letter  to stand for the ratio of a circle''s circumference to its diameter. He made numerous contributions to the study of topology, graph theory, calculus, combinatorics, and complex analysis, as evidenced by the multitude of theorems and notations named for him.\r\nOther important European mathematicians of the 18th century included Joseph Louis Lagrange, who did pioneering work in number theory, algebra, differential calculus, and the calculus of variations, and Laplace who, in the age of Napoleon, did important work on the foundations of celestial mechanics and on statistics.\r\n<br/>\r\nModern mathematics<br/>\r\n19th century<br/>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f12.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\nCarl Friedrich Gauss.\r\n<p>Throughout the 19th century mathematics became increasingly abstract. In the 19th century lived Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777â€“1855). Leaving aside his many contributions to science, in pure mathematics he did revolutionary work on functions of complex variables, in geometry, and on the convergence of series. He gave the first satisfactory proofs of the fundamental theorem of algebra and of the quadratic reciprocity law.</p>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f13.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p><p>Behavior of lines with a common perpendicular in each of the three types of geometry</p>\r\n<p>This century saw the development of the two forms of non-Euclidean geometry, where the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry no longer holds. The Russian mathematician Nikolai IvanovichLobachevsky and his rival, the Hungarian mathematician JÃ¡nosBolyai, independently defined and studied hyperbolic geometry, where uniqueness of parallels no longer holds. In this geometry the sum of angles in a triangle add up to less than 180Â°. Elliptic geometry was developed later in the 19th century by the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann; here no parallel can be found and the angles in a triangle add up to more than 180Â°. Riemann also developed Riemannian geometry, which unifies and vastly generalizes the three types of geometry, and he defined the concept of a manifold, which generalizes the ideas of curves and surfaces.\r\nThe 19th century saw the beginning of a great deal of abstract algebra. Hermann Grassmann in Germany gave a first version of vector spaces, William Rowan Hamilton in Ireland developed noncommutative algebra. The British mathematician George Boole devised an algebra that soon evolved into what is now called Boolean algebra, in which the only numbers were 0 and 1. Boolean algebra is the starting point of mathematical logic and has important applications in computer science.\r\nAugustin-Louis Cauchy, Bernhard Riemann, and Karl Weierstrass reformulated the calculus in a more rigorous fashion.\r\nAlso, for the first time, the limits of mathematics were explored. NielsHenrik Abel, a Norwegian, and Ã‰variste Galois, a Frenchman, proved that there is no general algebraic method for solving polynomial equations of degree greater than four (Abelâ€“Ruffini theorem). Other 19th-century mathematicians utilized this in their proofs that straightedge and compass alone are not sufficient to trisect an arbitrary angle, to construct the side of a cube twice the volume of a given cube, nor to construct a square equal in area to a given circle. Mathematicians had vainly attempted to solve all of these problems since the time of the ancient Greeks. On the other hand, the limitation of three dimensions in geometry was surpassed in the 19th century through considerations of parameter space and hypercomplex numbers.\r\nAbel and Galois''s investigations into the solutions of various polynomial equations laid the groundwork for further developments of group theory, and the associated fields of abstract algebra. In the 20th century physicists and other scientists have seen group theory as the ideal way to study symmetry.\r\nIn the later 19th century, Georg Cantor established the first foundations of set theory, which enabled the rigorous treatment of the notion of infinity and has become the common language of nearly all mathematics. Cantor''s set theory, and the rise of mathematical logic in the hands of Peano, L. E. J. Brouwer, David Hilbert, Bertrand Russell, and A.N. Whitehead, initiated a long running debate on the foundations of mathematics.\r\nThe 19th century saw the founding of a number of national mathematical societies: the London Mathematical Society in 1865, the SociÃ©tÃ©MathÃ©matique de France in 1872, the CircoloMatematico di Palermo in 1884, the Edinburgh Mathematical Society in 1883, and the American Mathematical Society in 1888. The first international, special-interest society, the Quaternion Society, was formed in 1899, in the context of a vector controversy.\r\nIn 1897, Hensel introduced p-adic numbers.\r\n</p><br/>In 1897, Hensel introduced p-adic numbers.<br/>\r\n20th century<br/>\r\n<center><img src="logo/f14.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center>\r\n<br/>\r\n<p>A map illustrating the Four Color Theorem</p>\r\n<p>The 20th century saw mathematics become a major profession. Every year, thousands of new Ph.D.s in mathematics were awarded, and jobs were available in both teaching and industry. An effort to catalogue the areas and applications of mathematics was undertaken in Klein''s encyclopedia.<p>\r\n<p>In a 1900 speech to the International Congress of Mathematicians, David Hilbert set out a list of 23 unsolved problems in mathematics. These problems, spanning many areas of mathematics, formed a central focus for much of 20th-century mathematics. Today, 10 have been solved, 7 are partially solved, and 2 are still open. The remaining 4 are too loosely formulated to be stated as solved or not.</p>\r\n<p>Notable historical conjectures were finally proven. In 1976, Wolfgang Haken and Kenneth Appel used a computer to prove the four color theorem. Andrew Wiles, building on the work of others, proved Fermat''s Last Theorem in 1995. Paul Cohen and Kurt GÃ¶del proved that the continuum hypothesis is independent of (could neither be proved nor disproved from) the standard axioms of set theory. In 1998 Thomas Callister Hales proved the Kepler conjecture.\r\nMathematical collaborations of unprecedented size and scope took place. An example is the classification of finite simple groups (also called the "enormous theorem"), whose proof between 1955 and 1983 required 500-odd journal articles by about 100 authors, and filling tens of thousands of pages. A group of French mathematicians, including Jean DieudonnÃ© and AndrÃ© Weil, publishing under the pseudonym "Nicolas Bourbaki", attempted to exposit all of known mathematics as a coherent rigorous whole. The resulting several dozen volumes has had a controversial influence on mathematical education.</p><br/>\r\n<p>Newtonian (red) vs. Einsteinian orbit (blue) of a lone planet orbiting a star, with relativistic precession of apsides\r\nDifferential geometry came into its own when Einstein used it in general relativity. Entire new areas of mathematics such as mathematical logic, topology, and John von Neumann''s game theory changed the kinds of questions that could be answered by mathematical methods. All kinds of structures were abstracted using axioms and given names like metric spaces, topological spaces etc. As mathematicians do, the concept of an abstract structure was itself abstracted and led to category theory. Grothendieck and Serre recast algebraic geometry using sheaf theory. Large advances were made in the qualitative study of dynamical systems that PoincarÃ© had begun in the 1890s. Measure theory was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Applications of measures include the Lebesgue integral, Kolmogorov''s axiomatisation of probability theory, and ergodic theory. Knot theory greatly expanded. Quantum mechanics led to the development of functional analysis. Other new areas include, Laurent Schwartz''s distribution theory, fixed point theory, singularity theory and RenÃ© Thom''s catastrophe theory, model theory, and Mandelbrot''s fractals. Lie theory with its Lie groups and Lie algebras became one of the major areas of study.\r\nNon-standard analysis, introduced by Abraham Robinson, rehabillitated the infinitesimal approach to calculus, which had fallen into disrepute in favour of the theory of limits, by extending the field of real numbers to the Hyperreal numbers which include infinitesimal and infinite quantities. An even larger number system, the surreal numbers were discovered by John Horton Conway in connection with combinatorial games.\r\nThe development and continual improvement of computers, at first mechanical analog machines and then digital electronic machines, allowed industry to deal with larger and larger amounts of data to facilitate mass production and distribution and communication, and new areas of mathematics were developed to deal with this: Alan Turing''s computability theory; complexity theory; Claude Shannon''s information theory; signal processing; data analysis; optimization and other areas of operations research. In the preceding centuries much mathematical focus was on calculus and continuous functions, but the rise of computing and communication networks led to an increasing importance of discrete concepts and the expansion of combinatorics including graph theory. The speed and data processing abilities of computers also enabled the handling of mathematical problems that were too time-consuming to deal with by pencil and paper calculations, leading to areas such as numerical analysis and symbolic computation. Some of the most important methods and algorithms of the 20th century are: the simplex algorithm, the Fast Fourier Transform, error-correcting codes, the Kalman filter from control theory and the RSA algorithm of public-key cryptography.\r\nAt the same time, deep insights were made about the limitations to mathematics. In 1929 and 1930, it was proved the truth or falsity of all statements formulated about the natural numbers plus one of addition and multiplication, was decidable, i.e. could be determined by some algorithm. In 1931, Kurt GÃ¶del found that this was not the case for the natural numbers plus both addition and multiplication; this system, known as Peano arithmetic, was in fact incompletable. (Peano arithmetic is adequate for a good deal of number theory, including the notion of prime number.) A consequence of GÃ¶del''s two incompleteness theorems is that in any mathematical system that includes Peano arithmetic (including all of analysis and geometry), truth necessarily outruns proof, i.e. there are true statements that cannot be proved within the system. Hence mathematics cannot be reduced to mathematical logic, and David Hilbert''s dream of making all of mathematics complete and consistent needed to be reformulated</p>\r\n<p>The absolute value of the Gamma function on the complex plane.</p>\r\n<p>One of the more colorful figures in 20th-century mathematics was SrinivasaAiyangarRamanujan (1887â€“1920), an Indian autodidact who conjectured or proved over 3000 theorems, including properties of highly composite numbers, the partition function and its asymptotics, and mock theta functions. He also made major investigations in the areas of gamma functions, modular forms, divergent series, hypergeometric series and prime number theory.\r\nPaul ErdÅ‘s published more papers than any other mathematician in history, working with hundreds of collaborators. Mathematicians have a game equivalent to the Kevin Bacon Game, which leads to the ErdÅ‘s number of a mathematician. This describes the "collaborative distance" between a person and Paul ErdÅ‘s, as measured by joint authorship of mathematical papers.\r\nEmmy Noether has been described by many as the most important woman in the history of mathematics,[134] she revolutionized the theories of rings, fields, and algebras.\r\nAs in most areas of study, the explosion of knowledge in the scientific age has led to specialization: by the end of the century there were hundreds of specialized areas in mathematics and the Mathematics Subject Classification was dozens of pages long.[135] More and more mathematical journals were published and, by the end of the century, the development of the world wide web led to online publishing<p><br/>\r\n21st century\r\n<p>In 2000, the Clay Mathematics Institute announced the seven Millennium Prize Problems, and in 2003 the PoincarÃ© conjecture was solved by Grigori Perelman (who declined to accept an award on this point).</p>\r\n<p>Most mathematical journals now have online versions as well as print versions, and many online-only journals are launched. There is an increasing drive towards open access publishing, first popularized by the arXiv.</p>\r\nFuture of mathematics\r\nMain article: Future of mathematics\r\n<p>There are many observable trends in mathematics, the most notable being that the subject is growing ever larger, computers are ever more important and powerful, the application of mathematics to bioinformatics is rapidly expanding, the volume of data to be analyzed being produced by science and industry, facilitated by computers, is explosively expanding</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', '1389795284ry_maths.jpg', 1, '0000-00-00');

Each of these words and phrases may be simple in structure, but can be substantial when received by your kids.</p>\r\n<li><b> I love you</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>This one is pretty self explanatory, but needs to be said. And, it can never be said too much.</p><br/>\r\n<li> <b>  How was your day? </b><br/></li>\r\nTake interest in whatÂ´s going on in their daily lives and let them tell you about it. Sometimes it tends to go on and on and on, but enjoy it while those days last. Before you know it your kids will be teens and this question will evoke an answer of "fine".\r\n<li> <b> IÂ´m sorry</b><br/></li>\r\nLet your kids know that you are also sometimes to blame. Being comfortable saying you are sorry is something everyone needs to learn how to do.\r\n<li> <b> You win! </b><br/></li>\r\nCongratulate them when they win and let them know how good it feels to be a winner.\r\n<li>  <b>  I win! </b><br/></li>\r\nDonÂ´t let them win all the time. Show them the value of competition and that winning something is not easy and not something to take for granted.\r\n<li> <b> Please</b><br/></li>\r\nCommon sense and good manners, but some kids donÂ´t use this word enough.\r\n<li> <b> Need help with your homework? </b><br/></li>\r\nSome kids may not want to, or feel comfortable with asking for your help with their homework. Let them know you are there for them if they need you.\r\n<li> <b> Do you want to go with me? </b><br/></li>\r\nKids love to go random places with their parents. Next time you head out the door, ask if they want to come with you. Usually they will.\r\n<li> <b> I missed you</b><br/></li>\r\nItÂ´s important to let them know you were thinking about them even if you werenÂ´t with them at the moment.\r\n <li> <b> Text me when you get there</b><br/></li>\r\nLet your kid know that you want to know when theyÂ´ve arrived safely. It teaches responsibility and allows them an easy way to reach back (via text) to relax your nerves.\r\n<li> <b> Good job! </b><br/></li>\r\n<p>This is another no-brainer but extremely important in reinforcing good work by your kid. Who gets tired of hearing this one? NOBODY</p>\r\n<li> <b> YouÂ´re so smart</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>This one boosts your kids confidence and letÂ´s them know they do offer something valuable. Let them know they are intelligent and they go into class, or any situation, with that feeling of "e;I can do this"e;. </p>\r\n<li> <b> ItÂ´s your choice</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Make sure you invite your kids to make decisions. If you make the decisions all the time, they wonÂ´t figure out what itÂ´s like to make a bad decision or the ramifications of what they choose. </p>\r\n <li> <b>  How are your friends? </b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Take interest in their circles. You need to stay abreast of who their friends are and what they are all about. If my daughter starts hanging around with guys in black trench coats, I wanna know about it. </p>\r\n<li> <b>  Keep trying, youÂ´ll get it</b><br/></li>\r\n\r\n<p>Teach them perseverance. When they accomplish something, it will make it all the more sweeter. </p>\r\n<li> <b> Turn off the TV</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Sometimes you need to step in and tell them to cut the TV off. DonÂ´t let them sit there and vegetate watching Honey Boo Boo nonsense. </p>\r\n<li> <b> ItÂ´s ok</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Let them know itÂ´s ok. It may seem simple, but it reinforces the fact that itÂ´s ok to try knew things or itÂ´s ok when something doesnÂ´t go exactly right. This encourages exploration and letÂ´s your kid know they can try without fear of consequences all the time. </p>\r\n<li> <b> Clean your room</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>ItÂ´s important to make them clean up around the house. Their room is (sort of) their domain, so make them own it and keep it up. This is something IÂ´m still working on. </p>\r\n<li> <b>  Want to go get some ice cream? </b><br/></li>\r\n<p>From time to time, spring a trip on them to get some ice cream. Who doesnÂ´t love ice cream? And who doesnÂ´t like a spontaneous and surprising trip to get some?. </p>\r\n<li> <b> You need to take responsibility</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Make sure they understand that they are responsible for their actions. They canÂ´t just lean on their parents all the time. </p>\r\n<li> <b> Read your book</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>LetÂ´s face it, kids arenÂ´t reading as much today due to all the electronic distractions in their life. We, as parents, need to continue to reinforce the fact they need to read. It is fundamental after all. </p>\r\n<li> <b>  Thank you</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Again, common sense, but all too often forgotten about. Make sure they say "e;thank you"e;. It speaks volumes about your character. </p>\r\n<li> <b>  Chew with your mouth closed</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Really. Teach them early. </p>\r\n<li> <b> I trust you</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Let them know you have faith in them. It will make them take ownership more quickly knowing you have their back. </p>\r\n<li> <b> You look nice today</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Continue to boost their self esteem by letting them know they look nice. Even adults love to get compliments on their appearance. With kids, I donÂ´t think they hear it enough. </p>\r\n<li> <b>  Stop it</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Put your foot down, especially in public. DonÂ´t let your kids run rampant or act foolish. Put a stop to it, quickly and decisively. </p>\r\n<li>  <b> Can you help me with this? </b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Engage your kids when trying to do something. Whether itÂ´s putting together something for the house or just doing something for work, get them involved and watch how they soak it up. </p>\r\n<li> <b> Eat your vegetables</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>They donÂ´t sell vegetables at McDonalds. Stop giving them crap to eat and start getting them to eat colorful food. Teach them young so they adopt a healthy lifestyle early. </p>\r\n<li> <b> Put the phone away</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>There are times where you need to step in and just tell them to put the phone away. ItÂ´s unacceptable for your tween/teen to just walk around nonstop pecking away on their phone</p>.\r\n<li> <b> You wanna play? </b><br/></li>\r\n</p>Kids love impromptu invitations to play. Out of the blue, surprise them and just ask them if they want to play. They will never turn you down and youÂ´ll both get a lot out of it. </p>\r\n <li> <b> You worked so hard on that</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Let them know they put in work to accomplish something. They may not realize the amount of effort they put in so make sure they understand hard work pays off. </p>\r\n<li> <b>  No</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>I know. I know. But, some parents just donÂ´t use this word with their kids. And when you DO use it, make sure you mean it. </p>\r\n<li> <b>  That was so cool</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Make sure you let your kids know when they do something cool. Your excitement is very rewarding for them and encourages them to do more of said cool thing. </p>\r\n\r\n<li> <b> Try it</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>DonÂ´t be afraid to let your kids try things. Ok, maybe not jumping off the roof onto a trampoline, but within limits, let them explore. Creativity and imagination are stoked by the act of trying. </p>\r\n<li>  <b> Good night</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Tell your kids "e;good night"e; every night. It letÂ´s them know you are there for them when they close their eyes and drift off. </p>\r\n<li>  <b>  IÂ´m proud of you</b><br/></li>\r\n<p>Your kids live for your admiration.

(2, 'Do you spend time with your kids ?  if you don''t here is a reason for you to start ', '<b>10 things that parents should never say to their children.</b>', '<p>Through my work, IÂ´ve had the privilege of speaking to and working with thousands of students, young adults and parents.\r\nTwo things have become painfully obvious to me.First, itÂ´s extraordinarily difficult to be a world-class parent.Second, a significant proportion of students and young adultsÂ´ frustrations are caused by their parents. IÂ´m not a parent myself, but IÂ´ve observed what many parents say to their children, which can negatively impact themâ€”sometimes for life.\r\nFrom a child and a studentÂ´s perspective, here are 10 things that parents should never say: </p>\r\n\r\n<li><b> "YouÂ´re useless" or "YouÂ´re a failure"</b><br></li>\r\nItÂ´s shocking how many parents say this to their children in a fit of anger.\r\nThis is the type of phrase that can scar children deeply, and can make them doubt their worth as a human being.\r\n<li><b>"I know whatÂ´s best for you" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>As a parent, you might feel like you really do know whatÂ´s best for your children, but using this phrase is not at all effective in convincing them that youÂ´re right.Instead, parents should do all they can to empower their children to take full responsibility for their choices and their life. </p>\r\n<li><b>"Because I said so!"\r\n<p>This is another phrase thatÂ´s unlikely to be persuasive. Parents need to establish boundaries for their children, but "Because I said so" isnÂ´t enough reason for children to be convinced that staying within those boundaries is a good idea. </p>\r\n<li><b>"I told you so" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>ItÂ´s tempting for parents to say this when it turns out that their advice that their children had ignored was, in fact, correct. If youÂ´re a parent, I urge you to refrain from using this phrase. Saying "I told you so" is sure to annoy your children and to cause strain in the relationship. </p>\r\n<li><b>"So clever!" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>Here are some instances where parents might exclaim "So clever!":</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A two-year-old keeps his or her toys after playing with them.</li>\r\n<li>A three-year-old says "Thank you" after receiving a present</li>\r\n<li>A 12-year-old decides to learn about EinsteinÂ´s theory of relativity.</p>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Parents (and all of us, in general) have subconsciously come to associate responsibility, politeness and curiosity with "cleverness".</p>\r\n<p>When they do this, however, they begin to unintentionally tell their children that intelligence is all-important, when in fact most of us would agree that integrity and morals are even more important. </p>\r\n<p>Parents should emphasize character and values, while not neglecting the worth of hard work and a love for learning. </p>\r\nWhen parents praise their child, they should be specific, rather than just saying "So clever!"\r\n<p>For example, they could say "That was kind of you to help that lady carry her groceries" or "That was generous of you to share your toys with your friend". </p>\r\n<li><b>"Why canÂ´t you be more likeâ€¦" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>ItÂ´s natural for parents to draw comparisons to other children, but doing so can cause psychological damage to their own children. </p>\r\n<p>Parents ought to focus on what makes their children unique, and encourage them to be the best version of themselves that they can be, instead of merely trying to be better than others. </p>\r\n<li><b>"I wish you werenÂ´t my son/daughter" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>Some parents say this when theyÂ´re feeling especially frustrated or upset with their children. </p>\r\n<p>IÂ´ve spoken to students whose parents had said this to them more than 10 years earlier, but they still harboured immense bitterness and resentment toward their parents for making such a hurtful statement. </p>\r\n<li><b>"YouÂ´re such a terrible boy/girl!" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>Children have a strange way of becoming the kind of person that their parents, as well as those closest to them, imagine them to be. </p>\r\n<p>When a child misbehaves, parents could say something like this instead: "This is so unlike you. YouÂ´re usually such a considerate and responsible boy. YouÂ´ll still be punished for misbehaving, but this is really not like you at all to do something so naughty." </p>\r\n<li><b>"You alwaysâ€¦" or "You neverâ€¦" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>When trying to correct their childÂ´s behaviour, itÂ´s much more effective for parents to point out specific instances or examples, rather than tell their child that "You always forget to do your chores" or "You never keep your promises". </p>\r\n<li><b>"DonÂ´t argue with me" </b><br></li>\r\n<p>When parents say this during a disagreement, they cause their child to feel even angrier and less willing to obey or compromise. </p>\r\n<p>Parents should reason with their child and explain their perspective calmly. ItÂ´s crucial that parents donÂ´t lose their cool! </p>', '1389160250re3.PNG', 1);

Do you ever stop to marvel at it’s incredible power and supreme cleverness? Or at least check in and give it a little spring clean and abrush-up from time to time?</p>\r\n<p>If you’re like the majority of the population, then your answer will be “no”.</p>\r\n<p>Astoundingly, we only use a mere 10% of our brains, yet seldom do we ever think to invest in a little training every now and then. For a long time, scientists believed that we were stuck with the brain we were born with! Luckily for us, that hypothesis has gone out the window!</p>\r\n<p>Check up neuroplasticity – a new theory that has proven one very incredible fact: <b>Our brains can change</b></p>\r\n<p>This means that if you’re not very intelligent in one area – that’s OK! You have the option to literally ‘change that area of your brain’ through a little training.</p>\r\n<p>An easy way to think about it is like this:</p>\r\n<b>Your brain is a muscle. You need to exercise it regularly.</b><br/>\r\n<p>The exciting thing is that you don’t have to be a millionaire to increase your brain capacity. All you need to do is invest a little time to regularly train your brain.</p>\r\nSo what can you do?<br/>\r\nHere are 10 simple ways you can increase your brain power and improve your intelligence!<br/>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><b>Do something new</b></li>\r\nWhen you experience something ‘new’ you actually ‘stimulate’ your brain! Don’t get stuck in a rut doing the same old things – the only way to change the structure of your brain is to do something new. This creates new neural pathways, increasing your intelligence. You could take a new route to work, try a new recipe for dinner, or even a new form of exercise – mix it up!\r\n<li><b>Exercise regularly</b></li>\r\nIt’s been proven that regular exercise helps to increase brain function and enhances neurogenesis. This means that every time you exercise you are creating new brain cells! Get off the couch and get moving! Your brain will thank you for it\r\n<li><b>Train your memory</b></li>\r\nHow often do you hear people say “I wish I had a better memory!’ Yet no-one does anything about this! If you discipline yourself to memorise phone numbers and other important numbers (passport, credit card, insurance, driving license) you will start to see a marked improvement in your memory.\r\n<li><b>Be curious</b></li>\r\nInstead of taking everything at face value, get into the habit of questioning everyday things/products, services that you come into contact with. By being ‘curious’ and questioning everything, you force your brain to innovate & create new ideas. Curiosity may have killed that cat, more importantly it created super important things like electricity and computers!\r\n<li><b>Think positive</b></li>\r\nStress & anxiety kill existing brain neurons and also stop new neurons from being created. Research has shown that positive thinking, especially in the future tense, speeds up the creation of cells and dramatically reduces stress & anxiety. Try and get a handle on negative thoughts and make an effort to replace them with positive ones.\r\n<li><b>Eat healthy</b></li>\r\nOur diets have a HUGE impact on brain function. Our brains consume over 20% of all nutrients & oxygen that we consume – so remember to feed your brain with the good stuff! (i.e. fresh fruit and veg & plenty of OMEGA 3 oils found in oily fish)\r\n<li><b>Read a book</b></li>\r\nReading relieves tension & stress (brain-cell killers) because it’s a form of escapism. Research has also shown that using your imagination is a great way to train your brain because you force your mind to ‘picture’ what you are imagining. Reading is a great way to trigger your imagination!\r\n<li><b>Get enough sleep</b></li>\r\nSleep is like a mini detox for the brain. This is when your body regenerates cells and removes all the toxins that have built up during the day. Get to bed between the hours of 9pm and midnight to benefit from the most effective hours of sleep!\r\n<li><b>Ban the calculator</b></li>\r\nRemember back at school when we were taught to use our brains to do simple sums like times tables?! It’s incredible how we now rely on devices like smart-phones and laptops to calculate really simple equations. Resist the urge to work things out using an external device – and use the device you were born with – your brain!\r\n<li><b>Stay hydrated</b></li>\r\n<p>Our bodies are largely made of water, so it makes sense that our brains are, too. Scientists say our brains are 80 percent water, so if we are not hydrated, our brain function can be impaired.<br/>\r\nResearchers say that lack of water can hamper oxygen flow to the brain or shrink neurons temporarily. Our size and our activity level affect our fluid requirements, but daily water needs range from about 13 cups for men to about nine cups for women (pregnant women and nursing mothers need a little more), including about 2 1/2 cups of water gained from foods. Water rich foods include lettuces and other greens, cucumber and watermelon.</P>\r\n\r\n<p align= “right”> Source: The Internet </p>\r\n', '1389795722-waves.jpg', 1, '2014-01-15'),

I had toys, books and even shows like Sesame Street . . </p>', 'Chemical Engineer Gets Unbalanced', '<h2><b>CHEMICAL ENGINEER GETS UNBALANCED</b></h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As a kid, I knew shapes were important. I had toys, books and even shows like Sesame Street teaching me about shapes. Somewhere along the line, I stopped getting the message. But thankfully the chemical engineers at MIT had greater focus than I did. Theyâ€™ve discovered a way to exploit the asymmetrical shape of tiny particles to make those particles behave in a specific way.</p>\r\n<p>This really blows my mind â€” the engineers designed these particles so that their shapes would cause them to follow predetermined pathways in microfluidic environments. This could lead to revolutionary developments in medical equipment, and hereâ€™s why.</p>\r\n<p>Current hardware for some types of medical analysis funnels particles through microchannels for analysis. But to keep everything orderly, the equipment needs extra instrumentation to make sure the particles travel in single file. More instrumentation means larger devices, limiting the portability and utility. But by exploiting this asymmetrical nature of particles, engineers might be able to design chips with microchannels in which the particles need no outside guidance to keep things nice and tidy.</p>\r\n<p>That could mean a new wave of medical devices that can be used in the field to help detect serious illnesses like cancer, increasing the chances of survival for millions of people. The particles, designed in the lab, will change as they come into contact with proteins or DNA that indicate the presence of cancer.</p>\r\n<p>Whatâ€™s so special about asymmetry? It all has to do with the flow of particles down these microchannels. Each particle looks like a tiny dumbbell with one side larger than the other. As the particle travels down the channel, the larger side creates drag and the dumbbell travels in a slanted orientation down the channel. This means it also begins to move closer to one side of the channel.</p>\r\n<p>But as it gets close to the channelâ€™s side, the fluid dynamics change. Perturbations caused by the particle reflect off the channelâ€™s wall and hit the particle. This makes the particle change its orientation, slanting in the opposite direction and moving it toward the other wall of the channel. With the right amount of asymmetry, the particle will travel pretty much down the center of the channel.</p>\r\n<p>How incredible is it that a new generation of medical devices could be more effective simply because engineers learned a little more about how shapes behave in a specific environment? Looks like itâ€™s time for me to watch a little more Sesame Street.</p>\r\n', '1389283202cal.PNG', 1, '0000-00-00'),
(3, 'For over a decade, the New Media Consortium (NMC) has been ..', '10 Emerging Educational Technologies & How They Are Being Used Across the Globe.<br>', 'For over a decade, the New Media Consortium (NMC) has been charting the landscape of emerging technologies in teaching, learning, and creative inquiry on a global scale.\r\nThe NMCâ€™s advisory board includes 750 technology experts and faculty members from colleges and universities in 40 countries, and is supported by the Consortium for School Networking (CoSN) and the International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE).<br>\r\nThe NMCâ€™s latest research efforts, the NMC Horizon Report: 2013 K-12 Edition and the NMC Horizon Report: 2013 Higher Education Edition, were released this spring, and together highlight ten emerging technologies that will impact education over the course of the next five years: cloud computing, mobile learning, learning analytics, open content, 3D printing, MOOCs, virtual and remote laboratories, games and gamification, tablet computing, and wearable technology.<br>\r\nAs an educator, you have probably heard about many of these technologies, if not all of them. But the Horizon Report project pushes the discussion into fresh territory, predicting a time frame for their implementation into mainstream education and presenting an impressive list of institutions and individuals who are already using them in every discipline imaginable.</p><br>\r\nToo often it is educationâ€™s own practices that limit the broader uptake of new technologies. Whether itâ€™s insufficient ongoing professional development or the reluctance to accept the need for digital media literacy, significant challenges stand in the way of smooth assimilation.<br>\r\nWhat the Horizon reports show, howeverâ€”even more than which technologies are rising to the topâ€” is that smooth assimilation is possible, and that countless educators are making the move creatively and with admirable conviction.</p><br>\r\n<h1><b>Here is a little inspiration from the people who are doing it right:</b></h1><br>\r\n<b><h3>1. Cloud Computing (12 Months or Less)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>In 2011, cloud computing was listed in the 12-month-or-less category of the report, primarily because of the way it had become an essential part of collaboration in both schools and the workplace. This year, the placement of cloud computing on the near-term horizon for a second time underscores the fact that the impact of this technology continues to unfold in new and expanding ways.</p><br>\r\n<b>Language:</b><p>The cloud-based Brazilian Electronic Learning Organizer helps language teachers produce and share digital learning objects and activities for their students. The learning objects are created by the teacher or assembled from a resource repository created by other teachers in the network.</p></br>\r\n<b>Science:</b><p>California State University Northridge launched the Computer Supported Collaborative Science initiative to help science teachers in high-need Los Angeles-area schools to engage students in authentic research experiences through the use of cloud-based tools.</p><br>\r\n<b>Social Studies:</b><p> Powered by cloud computing, the Global Curriculum Project allows students to participate in a virtual exchange program with school across five different countries. Students select and explore their own topics, including cuisine and ambitions.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>2. Mobile Learning (12 Months or Less)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>By the end of this year, the mobile market is expected to consist of over 7 billion accounts (equating to about 3.4 billion users, or one in every two people on the planet); mobile traffic on the Internet is expected to surpass desktop traffic; and mobile users will have downloaded 70 billion apps across smartphones and tablets. Educational apps are the second-most downloaded in iTunes of all categories, surpassing both entertainment and business apps in popularity.</p><br>\r\n<b>Mathematics:</b><p>Year four students at St. Leonardâ€™s College, a primary school in Australia, are using tablets loaded with math apps and e-textbooks to access information, receive instruction, record measurements, and conduct research.</p><br>\r\n<b>Music:</b><p>Students at Institut International de Lancy in Switzerland use their tablets to create music in the schoolâ€™s first iPad Orchestra. The iPads have provided opportunities for students with little to no training to create their own music with classmates.</p><br>\r\n<b>Storytelling:</b><p>Ringwood North Primary School in Australia participated in â€œThe Epic Citadel Challenge,â€ wherein students and teachers collaborated to write a digital story based on the Epic Citadel environment and turn it into an app accessible via iOS mobile devices.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>3. Tablet Computing (12 Months or Less)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>It is so easy for students to carry tablets from class to class, using them to seamlessly access textbook and other course material as needed, that schools and universities are rethinking the need for computer labs or even personal laptops. A studentâ€™s choice of apps makes it easy to build a personalized learning environment, with all the resources and tools they need on a single device. With their growing number of features, tablets give traction to other educational technologiesâ€” from facilitating the real-time data mining needed to support learning analytics to offering a plethora of game-based learning apps.</p><br>\r\n<b>Art:</b><p>At Plymouth University in the UK, students working toward their Illustration degree are using iPads with an illustration app called Brushes to produce drawings that can be played back as video. This activity is encouraging reflection and discussion on the drawing process and enabling students to contrast techniques and highlight and correct any bad habits.</p><br>\r\n<b>Science:</b><p>Students at Redlands College in Australia are using tablets to collect and share data on indigenous rocks; geology majors at the College of Wooster in Ohio are using them to take and annotate photos of Icelandic terrain; and instructors at Yale University are sharing images from their digital microscopes with studentsâ€™ iPads through mobile apps so that they can annotate and capture images for future use.</p><br>\r\n<b>Journalism:</b><p>Professor Messner at Virginia Commonwealth University secured iPads for his students so they could create multimedia news stories from happenings on campus and in the surrounding community. The students learned the importance of social media in journalism and found the iPad useful for gathering news and sources.</p><br>\r\n<b>Special Needs:</b><p>Vanderbilt University graduate students are designing an Android app that enables visually impaired students to learn math. Using haptic technology integrated into new touchscreen devices, the vibrations and audio feedback help students feel and hear shapes and diagrams.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>4. MOOCs (12 Months or Less)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>A number of respected thought leaders believe that the current MOOC model has deviated significantly from the initial premise outlined by George Siemens and Stephen Downes in 2008, emphasizing lecture over connectivity, but either way, educators across the globe are doing some amazing things with MOOCs. The hope is that they will eventually strike a balance between automating the assessment process while delivering personalized, authentic learning opportunities.</p><br>\r\n<b>Music:</b><p>This spring, Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis and the Purdue University Department of Music and Arts Technology began offering their first MOOC, â€œMusic for the Listenerâ€ that can be converted into credit. The learning environment is being delivered through Course Networking, with full translation features, rich media, and social networking tools.</p><br>\r\n<b>Physics:</b><p>An MOOC called â€œLandmarks in Physics,â€ pioneered by an MIT graduate and delivered through Udacity, takes students on a virtual tour through Italy, the Netherlands, and England while explaining the basic concepts of physics at the sites of important discoveries in world history.</p><br>\r\n<b>Writing:</b><p>Ohio State University has partnered with Coursera to create a course that engages participants as writers, reviewers, and editors in a series of interactive reading, composition, and research activities with assignments designed to help them become more efficient consumers and producers of alphabetic, visual, and multimodal texts.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>5. Open Content (2-3 Years)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>While open content has been available for a long time, the topic has received increased attention in recent years. The use of open content promotes a skill set that is critical in maintaining currency in any area of studyâ€”the ability to find, evaluate, and put new information to use. <br>The same cannot be said for many textbooks, which can be cumbersome, slow to update, and particularly costly for K-12 schools. More educators are tapping into the wealth of content within open repositories and familiarizing themselves with the Creative Commons protocol.</p>\r\n<b>History:</b><p>Learn NC is a program developed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Education to make resources and best practices in K-12 freely and widely available. Their digital textbook for eighth grade history contains a collection of primary sources, readings, and multimedia that can be searched and rearranged.</p><br>\r\n<b>Mathematics:</b><p>Arizona instructor James Sousa, who has been teaching math for 15 years at both the community college and K-12 levels, developed more than 2,600 video tutorials on topics from arithmetic to calculus, all of which are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution.</p><br>\r\n<b>Science:</b><p>A partnership between Bringham Young Universityâ€™s David Wiley and the Hewlett Foundation sparked a project in which teachers from 18 districts and four charter schools across Utah pulled together science resources to create free digital textbooks.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>6. Learning Analytics (2-3 Years)</h3></b><br>\r\n<center><img src="logo/analytical.PNG" width="200" height="200"></center><br/>\r\n <p>Whileanalyzing student data is not a new practice, the field of learning analytics has only recently gained wide support among data scientists and education professionals. In the coming years, as learning analytics platforms become increasingly complex and effective, outcomes of learning analytics will have a significant impact on the evolution and refinement of both K-12 and higher education, especially in the design of personalized and online learning platforms.</p><br>\r\n<b>Mathematics:</b><p>Developed by a group of educators, programmers, and data scientists, Mathspace is an online program that meets the demands of the NSW syllabus and Australian National Curriculum for students aged seven to ten. The platform monitors how students reason through math problems and provides personalized feedback as well as analytics reports for teachers.</p><br>\r\n<b>Reading:</b><p>Knot, an e-textbook company, launched the â€œKno Meâ€ tool, which provides students with insights into their study habits and behaviors while using e-textbooks. Students can also better pace themselves by looking at data that shows them how much time they spent working through specific texts, and where they are in relation to their goals.</p><br>\r\n<b>Writing:</b><p>The University of North Carolina Greensboro uses the Mobius Social Learning Information Platform to create intensive writing courses which facilitate anonymous, peer-to-peer feedback and grading. When students submit an essay, it is automatically distributed to the rest of their randomly chosen peer group, and an algorithm turns their feedback into statistics and performance reports.</p></br>\r\n<b>Special Education:</b><p>Constant Therapy is a mobile platform that leverages data analytics and mobile technology to provide personalized therapy for people with cognitive, language, communication, and learning disorders. With 15 yearsâ€™ worth of content developed by Boston University, Constant Therapyâ€™s lessons adapt to meet the needs of learners while allowing language educators to monitor their progress via an analytics dashboard.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>7. Games and Gamification (2-3 Years)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>Game play has traversed the realm of recreation and infiltrated commerce, productivity, and education, proving to be a useful training and motivation tool. Referred to as â€œGame-Based Learningâ€ in previous NMC Horizon reports, this field of practice has expanded far beyond integrating digital and online games into the curriculum. The updated category title reflects the perspective that while games are effective tools for scaffolding concepts and simulating real world experiences, it should also include the larger canvas of gamer culture and game design.</p><br>\r\n<b>Architecture:</b><p>SimArchitect is a simulation game and social connection site for architects developed by IBM Center for Advanced Learning. Players are issued a request for proposal by a fictitious client and must respond, conducting meetings with the client and team and then proposing a solution. IBM created a performance scorecard that evaluates the playerâ€™s communication, architectural methods, and more.</p><br>\r\n<b>History:</b><p>The Historical Williamsburg Living Narrative project at the University of Florida is an effort to create an interactive fictional game in which the geography, culture, and characters of Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia will be brought to life. Functional maps show the early architecture of the buildings, and interactive scenarios with characters like George Washington and Patrick Henry allow students to participate in discussions of the times.</p><br>\r\n<b>Nursing:</b><p>The University of Minnesotaâ€™s School of Nursing has partnered with the Minnesota Hospital Association and the technology firm, VitalSims, to develop web-based interactive games that engage nursing students with real-life scenarios. With initial versions of the game already completed, health care educators are expecting to launch these digital learning tools later in 2013.</p><br>\r\n<h1><b>8. 3D Printing (4-5 Years)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>While 3D printing is four to five years away from widespread adoption in schools, it is easy to pinpoint the practical applications that will take hold. Geology and anthropology students, for instance, can make and interact with models of fossils and other artifacts, and organic chemistry students can print out models of complex proteins and other molecules through rapid prototyping and production tools. Even more compelling are institutions that are using 3D technology to develop brand new tools.</p><br>\r\n<b>Archaeology:</b><p>Harvard Universityâ€™s Semitic Museum uses 3D printing technology to restore damaged artifacts from its collection. For example, by 3D scanning existing fragments of an Egyptian lionâ€™s legs, researchers can create computer models that will be used to print a scale foam replica of the complete structure, even though it was originally missing its body and head.</p><br>\r\n<b>Astronomy:</b> In an effort to engage inner-city students in STEM-related fields, Minnesota non-profit STARBASE has created an aerospace-themed curriculum where students plan a mission to Mars. A highlight of the project is the use of 3D printing technology to create a working rocket that students launch on the final day of the program.</p><br>\r\n<b>Business:</b><p>In early 2013, Darwin High School in Australia initiated a project intended to expose students to micro-business concepts through product development and workflow analysis. Using 3D printers, students rapidly prototype ideas, explore product design, and learn how to market their goods.</p><br>\r\n<b>Computer Science:<b><p>Students at Glacier Peak High School in Washington can receive college credit for taking computer-aided design classes featuring the incorporation of 3D printers for rapid prototype development. The courses include modeling and design, tolerance specification, documentation drawing, and assembly modeling.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>9. Virtual and Remote Laboratories (4-5 Years)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>Virtual and remote laboratories reflect the current trend in K-12 education toward more authentic online education. Though technology is four to five years away from mainstream use in schools, the benefits of implementation are already clear. Virtual and remote labs offer flexibility, as students can run experiments as many times as they like, both in and out of school. Because these labs are designed to allow for easy repetition of experiments, students feel less pressure to execute perfectly the first time. In the controlled environments of these labs, students are safe, even if they make an error.</p><br>\r\n<b>Chemistry:</b><p>Dr. David Yaron, Associate Professor Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University, developed ChemCollective, a project of the National Science Digital Library, to create flexible interactive learning environments in which high school students can approach chemistry more like practicing scientists.</p><br>\r\n<b>Marine Biology:</b><p>In Lysekil, Sweden, high school students use virtual tools to explore the marine environment of Gullmar Fjord on the Swedish west coast, learning in the process how scientific knowledge is created. The students use a virtual ocean acidification laboratory to conduct studies on the acidification of the marine environment.</p><br>\r\n<b>Mathematics:</b><p>High School students in North Carolina are using Geometerâ€™s Sketchpad to understand how theorems are developed. The software is accessed through North Carolina State Universityâ€™s virtual computing lab, a cloud-based learning environment with an interactive online community where teachers share tips on the software used as well as the projects undertaken.</p><br>\r\n<h3><b>10. Wearable Technology (4-5 Years)</h3></b><br>\r\n<p>Perhaps the least educationally applicable but most complex technology of the NMC report is wearable technology. Googleâ€™s â€œProject Glassâ€ is one of the most talked-about current examples. One of the most promising potential outcomes of wearable technology in higher education is productivity: tools that could automatically send information via text, e-mail, and social networks on behalf of the userâ€”based on voice commands, gestures, and other indicatorsâ€” that would help students and educators communicate with one another, keep track of updates, and better organize notifications.</p><br>\r\n<b>Chemistry:</b><p>A team from the Centre for Sensor Web Technologies at Dublin City University is building a wearable sensor that detects hazardous gases and immediately alerts the user of these conditions.</p><br>\r\n<b>Geology:</b><p>Wearable cameras like Memoto, a tiny GPS-enabled camera that clips to a userâ€™s shirt collar or button and takes two five-megapixel shots per minute, could benefit geologists or archaeologists in the field, capturing hundreds of photographs or data about a userâ€™s surroundings on an offsite dig which can later be accessed via e-mail or social media.</p><br>\r\n<b>Neuroscience:</b><p>A new brain-sensing headband called Muse displays a userâ€™s brain activity directly onto their smartphone or tablet, in effect making it possible to control actions with oneâ€™s thoughts and to collect data about the brainâ€™s reaction to various stimuli.</p>\r\n', '1389435493re.PNG', 1, '0000-00-00'),
(4, 'Sometimes youâ€™re out in the middle of nowhere and need to make an unexpected repair, but you donâ€™t have the right tools', '12 Most Advanced Agricultural Technologies', '<p>By Brian Scott on Mar 12, 2012 in Blog, Business, Technology<b>&nbsp;Sometimes youâ€™re out in the middle of nowhere and need to make an unexpected repair, but you donâ€™t have the right tools. Not a problem for a farmer. In a pinch you can make something else work for you 9 times out of 10.</b></p>\r\n<p>Farmers are also great at adopting new technology. Nowadays tools on many farms and ranches are very sophisticated. From tractors that drive themselves to cows that text, the modern farmerâ€™s toolbox contains a host of cool toys.</p><br>\r\n<b>Here are 12 of the most advanced agricultural technologies employed today:</b>\r\n<h2><b>1. Tractors on autopilot</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Thanks to GPS tractors, combines, sprayers and more can accurately drive themselves through the field. After the user has told the onboard computer system how wide a path a given piece of equipment will cover he will drive a short distance setting A & B points to make a line. Then the GPS system will have a track to follow and it extrapolates that line into parallel lines set apart by the width of the tool in use.<br>\r\nThese systems are capable of tracking curved lines as well. The tracking system is tied to the tractorâ€™s steering, automatically keeping it on track freeing the operator from driving. This allows the operator to keep a closer eye on other things. Guidance is great for tillage because it removes human error from overlap, saving fuel and equipment hours. Trust me when I tell you that once you starting auto tracking, youâ€™ll never go back manual steering.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>2. Swath control and variable rate technology</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Building on GPS technology are swath control and VRT. This is where guidance really begins to show a return on investment. Swath control is just what it sounds like. The farmer is controlling the size of the swath a given piece of equipment takes through the field. This video is a great visual representation of how swath control works.<br>\r\n\r\nThe savings come from using less inputs like seed, fertilizer, herbicides, etc. Since the size and shapes of fields are irregular you are bound to overlap to some extent in every application. Thanks to GPS mapping the equipment in the field already knows where it has been. Swath control shuts off sections of the applicator as it enters the overlap area, saving the farmer from applying twice the inputs on the same piece of ground.<br>\r\nVRT works in a similar fashion. Based on production history and soil tests a farmer can build a prescription GPS map for an input. By knowing what areas of a field are most and least productive the application rate of an input like fertilizer can be tailored to increase or decrease automatically at the appropriate time. This is a big benefit for farms. Instead of applying a set rate of fertilizer over the entire field (many times a high rate to help those low producing areas) an operator can now apply a rate most effective for a particular section of ground.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>3. Your tractor is calling</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Telematics is being touted as the next big thing in ag. This technology allows equipment to talk to farmers, equipment dealers, and even other equipment. Imagine you have a problem in the field and have to stop working. With telematics your dealer can access the onboard diagnostic system of your tractor.<br> Depending on the problem they might be able to fix your equipment right from dealer. No waiting on a mechanic to drive out to wherever you might be. Youâ€™re back to work, and the dealer saved a trip too. Farmers will be able to keep track of what field equipment is in, fuel consumption, operating hours, and much more. Personally Iâ€™ve noticed on our farm as we become more technologically advanced our downtime is often caused by electrical, software, or hardware problems as opposed to mechanical.<br>\r\nTractors can even communicate between themselves. The best example is a combine and a grain cart. Grain carts pull up next to harvesting equipment so the harvester can unload on the move without stopping to unload. Telematics can tell the grain cart operator when a combine is filling up with grain. Even better if one cart is chasing two combines.<br>The driver knows which machine needs unloading first. The latest innovation has the combine operator actually taking wireless control of the tractor pulling the grain cart as it pulls alongside, giving him the ability to shuttle the cart forward and back to more easily fill the cart.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>4. Your cow is calling too</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>And itâ€™s not saying â€œMoo!â€ Collars developed for livestock are helping producers keep track of their herds. Sensors in the collar send information to a rancherâ€™s smartphone giving the rancher a heads up on where a cow might be, or maybe sheâ€™s in some sort of distress, or maybe just in the mood for some mating. <br>I suppose you could say itâ€™s kind of like telematics for cows!\r\nRFID tags are also a handy device for livestock management. The information kept on a tag helps producers keep track of individual animals, speeding up and making record keeping more precise. I recently read about RFID tags placed in to hay as it is baled. Data such as moisture and weight can be stored in the tag to be scanned later.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>5. Irrigate via smartphone</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Mobile tech is playing a big role in monitoring and controlling crop irrigation systems. With the right equipment a farmer can control his irrigation systems from a phone or computer instead of driving to each field. Moisture sensors in the ground are able to communicate information about the level of moisture present at certain depths in the soil. <br>This increased flexibility allows for more precise control of water and other inputs like fertilizer that are applied by irrigation pivots. Farmers can also combine this with other tech like VRT mentioned earlier to control the rate of water applied. Itâ€™s all about more effective and efficient use of resources. I read a magazine article recently where a farmer stated that because of these technologies his total water usage is now less than what he was wasting previously.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>6. Sensing how your crop is feeling</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Crop sensors. This is taking variable rate technology to the next level. Instead of making a prescription fertilizer map for a field before you go out to apply it, crop sensors tell application equipment how much to apply in real time.<br>Optical sensors are able to see how much fertilizer a plant may need based on the amount of light reflected back to the sensor. I havenâ€™t seen one of these systems in operation yet, but Iâ€™m keeping a close eye on them. Itâ€™s fairly new and pretty expensive, but I see huge potential here. Crop sensors are going to help farmers apply fertilizer in a very effective manner, maximizing uptake and reducing potential leaching and runoff into ground water.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>7. Field documentation</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Because of onboard monitors and GPS the ability to document yields, application rates, and tillage practices is becoming easier and more precise every year. In fact farmers are getting to the point where they have so much good data on hand that it can be overwhelming to figure out what to do with all of it.<br>\r\nAnd of course, every farmerâ€™s favorite form of documentation is the yield map. It sums up a yearâ€™s worth of planning and hard work on a piece of colorful paper. As harvesting equipments rolls through the field it calculates yield and moisture as it goes tying it in with GPS coordinates. When finished a map of the field is printed. These maps are often called heat maps. I liken then to weather radar maps. Each color on the map relates to a certain yield range. <br>Now the farmer can see what varieties had the best, worst, or most consistent yield over varying conditions. Maps like this can tell a farmer how well a fieldâ€™s drainage system is working. (In case you werenâ€™t aware, there is a massive network of private and public drainage at work underground on farms.) All this data allows for better agronomic decisions in the future.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>8. Biotechnology</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Biotech or genetic engineering (GE) isnâ€™t new tech, but it is a very important tool with much more potential yet to be unleashed. The form of GE most people have probably heard of is herbicide resistance. The other would likely be insect resistant traits. Crops can be made to express toxins that control particular pests.<br> Many employ Bt toxin that is the same toxin found in some organic pesticides. That means a farmer wonâ€™t have to make a pass through his fields to apply pesticide, which not only saves on pesticide, but fuel, labor, and wear on equipment too.\r\nNew biotech coming online right now are things like drought resistant traits and nitrogen use efficiency. What does that mean? In short it means that crops are going to be able to protect more potential yield in drought conditions. <br>Another way to look at it would be that farmers who irrigate their crops can cut back on water use and not see yields suffer. Nitrogen use efficiency is a lot like that except youâ€™re doing it with fertilizer instead of water. A single crop variety can be made to express one, two, three or potentially even all of these traits in a single plant.</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>9. Donâ€™t forget to flush</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Ray Prock dedicated a whole blog post on how he manages cow manure on his California dairy. Iâ€™m sure most people know that manure makes good fertilizer, but itâ€™s the method Ray uses to collect it for use that is so cool. An automatic system uses water to flush manure away from the cattle into a holding area where all the solid matter dries up. After it dries the solid manure can be picked up and further processed.<br>\r\nThe liquid manure continues on into another area. From here it can be pumped out and used to fertilize Rayâ€™s crop or it can be sent back in to flush out more manure. A metering device lets him know exactly how much liquid is used so that just the right amount is placed on the crops. <br>Excess nutrients are at risk of reaching groundwater, but Ray is all over that too. Irrigation runoff is captured in ponds and is recycled over and over again in the system. For more high tech farm goodness head on over to the Android market and download Mr. Prockâ€™s app for his farm blog! Itâ€™s the only one Iâ€™m aware exists!</p><br>\r\n<h2><b>10. Ultrasounds and more for livestock</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>They arenâ€™t just for checking on baby animals in the womb. Ultrasounds can be used to discover what quality of meat might be found in an animal before it goes to market. DNA testing helps producers identify animals with good pedigrees and other desirable qualities. This information can then be use to improve the quality of the herd which helps the farmer improve his bottom line.</p><br>\r\n\r\n\r\n<h2><b>11. Thereâ€™s an app for that</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Mobile tech is big in ag and itâ€™s getting bigger all the time. Farmers and ranchers are using all the social media sites for all types of reasons. Some are using apps like foursquare to keep tabs on employees. You might even catch me on a twitter chat tweeting away right from the tractor cab. The tractor is driving itself and my hands are free (see item #1) so why not?<br>\r\nApps can control irrigation and grain storage systems. Want to load grain into a truck without getting out of the cab?LoadOut Technologies has you covered. I canâ€™t tell you how many times the flashlight app on my phone comes in handy. Even the camera can be put to work on the farm. If you think you might forget how something goes back together after you take it apart take a picture of it assembled. <br>On my phone I have apps that show me soil type via GPS, agricultural news and markets, insect pests, calculations for mixing herbicide solutions, and one that tracks growing degree days. GDDs are an index based on temperature that gives a grower an idea of how mature a crop may be. If you plan on visiting the National Farm Machinery Show in Louisville, you wonâ€™t have to carry around a map all day that shows vendors booths and event schedules. Thereâ€™s an app for that too.<br>\r\nAnd weâ€™re finally getting to where we can take all that data I talked about earlier and have access to it on smartphones and tablets. Precision Planting just came out with an iPad app that does just that. Iâ€™m very excited to watch this kind of tech develop in combination with many of the things listed above.</p>\r\n<h2><b>12. Smile for the camera</h2></b><br>\r\n<p>Putting up cameras around the farm is a trend thatâ€™s catching on. We have a rear-facing camera on the back of the combine that shows up on a monitor in the cab. I can think of all kinds of places to put cameras on large pieces of equipment to help eliminate blind spots. Our grain cart is wide enough that you canâ€™t see around it so Iâ€™d like to have one out back to I know if Iâ€™m holding up traffic when driving from field to field. Another idea would be to have a camera or two looking at the implement behind the tractor. Craning your neck around left and right all day to look behind you gets a little painful after a while.<br>\r\nLivestock managers are wiring up their barns, feedlots, and pastures with cameras that send images back to a central location like an office or home computer. They can keep a closer eye on animals when they are away or home for the night. Val Wagner told me she is setting up cameras to monitor cows during calving season. Her hope is that by being able to watch the cows during this critical time they can lessen the chance of calves being born outside on those well below zero North Dakota nights.<br>\r\nSo now youâ€™re up to speed on some of the latest and greatest things going on in agriculture. Itâ€™s all about more data, efficiency, and precision. Farmers and ranchers have a lot of awesome stuff to help them produce a bountiful harvest. So long as Mother Nature chooses to play along. Sheâ€™ll come up with at least one monkey wrench each year no matter what you do, but that goes with the territory.</p>\r\n', '1389777747d_agric.jpg', 1, '0000-00-00');

Example are temperature, rainfall, light, hydrogen ion concentration (PH value), wind pressure etc. <br/>\r\nAbiotic factors determine the kind of biotic community that is found on a habitat. Some of these factors are important to most habitats, while others are uniquely important to a specific habitat such as terrestrial habitat or an aquatic type. <br/>\r\nThere are many factors that are common to the two contrasting habitats (terrestrial and aquatic). They include temperature, rainfall, light intensity, hydrogen ion concentration (PH value), winds and pressure. Of these factors, temperature and rainfall determine the setting of the community.</p><br/>', '<p>at the end of the lesson, you should be able to</p><br/>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Explain Abiotic/Biotic factors.</li>\r\n<li>List factors common to all habitats.</li>\r\n<li>Write short note on the factors affecting aquatic habitat.</li>\r\n<li>List the factors affecting terrestrial habitat.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<br/>\r\n', '<p>An Abiotic is the non-living that interacts with the living (biotic) in their dwelling environment. Some biotic factors may affect an organism in many ways. For example, when competitors, parasites, prey, or symbionts are in abundance with time, the relationship between the Abiotic and biotic may be affected if the available resource such as water, food, mates, and shelter can no longer support the biotic i.e. plant and animals.</p><br/>\r\n<p>Temperature, rainfall, height light intensity, hydrogen ion concentration (PH value), wind and pressure are the factors that are common to all habitats, but temperature rainfall determine the major brome (a community that is characterized by a dominant type of vegetation) such tropical rainfall, rainforest, grassland, desert and tundra of the world.</p></p>\r\n<h3><b>Temperature:</b> </h3><br/><p>it is one of the climate factors that is common to both terrestrial and aquatic habitats. But terrestrial habitats show a higher temperature range than aquatic ones. In temperature countries, there are seasonal temperature difference ranges. In winter the temperature is below O0C and above 200c in summer. In the tropic lower temperature are usually recorded during wet season and lower during dry season. In West Africa during the harmattan, a cool wind, blows and lower temperatures are recorded.</p><br/>\r\n<p>In aquatic habitats, temperature decrease with depth. For instance, in marine water bodies, the depth is 1500m is 40C but the temperature at the surface is 300C. on the other hand decrease in height, there is always a drop of 10C for every 150m rise above sea level.</p><br/>\r\n<p>Most organism cannot withstand high temperature because at higher temperature, they are killed, at lower temperature, they are inactive; and at optimum temperatures they grow and reproduce rapidly. Some animal show adaptation that allow that allow them to live at low temperature and high temperature such as hibernation and aestivation in the temperature and arctic region respectively. When temperature are favorable for life, there is variation in such biotic set up (plants and animals) with very large communities.</p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>Rainfall:</b> </h3><br/><p>Its is the most important factors that affect the biotic community of a terrestrial habitat. For example, an annual rainfall of 1800mm, result in a luxuriant rainforest, while an unreliable annual rainfall below 250mm result into barren desert. Reason, is that water is life and the main consistent of living organism.</p><br/>\r\n<b>Light intensity:</b> <p>Light is very important for photosynthesis to take place and plants cannot grow in the dark. Likewise some organism are affected by the distribution of light, some are light by others are shade-tolerant species</p>.<br/>\r\n<h3><b>Hydrogen ion concentration (PH value) :</b></h3><br/><p>Is given by Ph value, it is a scale use in expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution which range from 1 to 14, with PH 1 is very acidity, Ph 7 is neutral while PH 14, is very alkalinity.</p><br/>\r\n<p>Most soils have PH ranges of 4.5 (strongly acidic) and such soil is good for rice production while some soil have 8.3 PH which is fairly alkaline which support the major crop productions. Some organism such as fresh water molecule cannot withstand PH value less than 6.5 PH, they are usually absent from freshwater medium. Most plants thrive well in neutral or slightly alkaline soil but ascorbic soil support very little crop e.g rice.</p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>Wind: </b></h3><br/><p>Air in motion is termed wind and winds are important to habitats (aquatic and terrestrial) because they cause water current and waves, and also carry rain bearing cloud. In West Africa, Nigeria winds influence the climate, wind causing the dry harmattan from the Sahara causing the dry season and a rain bearing south-westerly  winds from the ocean causing a numeral rainy season. The winds are responsible for;</p><br/>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The local brome such as rainforest, grassland. </li>\r\n<li>Winds help in the dispersal of fruit and seeds and cause pollination in some plants such as grasses.</li>\r\n<li>The drying effect of strong winds cause high transpiration (loss of water vapour form the plant) rates which affect the types of plant that are formed in the regions exposed to such conditions.</li>\r\n<li>Insect spread faster in the direction of winds in a given area even though the other direction offered the same opportunity for their establishment.</li></ol><br/>\r\n<h3><b>Pressure:</b> </h3><br/><p>In the ocean pressure varies from the depth of the ocean to the highest altitudes of the atmosphere. Atmosphere pressure increase as we go down the sea level. In the oceans, the pressure increase by 1.03kg/m2 in every 10m. Organisms found living at depth of about 400m live in conditions of abundance pressure and are well adapted to such condition since they cannot survive at the surface waters where the pressure is much lower.</p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>Step III</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>Some biotic organisms (plants and animals) are structurally adapted to live in aquatic meelia. For instance, fishes are able to dwell in water due to the presence of fins that enable them to swim, whales, sharks are able to line water due to the possession of flippers and some plant have sticky bodies, reduced cuticles, well developed air space (for the supply for oxygen) that equally enable them to dwell in aquatic medium.</p><br/>\r\n<p>There some factors those only operate in such habitat. Examples of the factors are as follows:</p><br/> <ol>\r\n<li>Salinity</li>\r\n<li>Density</li>\r\n<li>Turbidity</li>\r\n<li>Current or water waves, tidal movement and waves</li>\r\n<li>Dissolved gases</li>\r\n<li>Nature of the substratum </li></ol><br/>\r\n<h3><b>SALINITY:</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>Salinity is concentration of dissolved salts in water. The rate of salinity is very high in sea water but very low in freshwater meaning sea water is salty but in brackish water (sea water and freshwater mixed together to form brackish). At the mouths and swamps of brackish water, salinity charges with tides.</p><br/>\r\n<p>Aquatic organism have homeostatic behavior to main the emetic balance between their internal and external environment as shown below</p><br/>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Organisms living in water have the adaptation for bringing the excess water from their bodies.</li>\r\n<li>Sea water organisms have no problem because the sea is almost the same with their internal environment and</li>\r\n<li>Those living in brackish water have tissues that tolerate changes in the concentration of salts in their body fluid.</li></ol>\r\n<h3><b>DENSITY:</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>Air is less dense than water. Hence, its easier to move through air than water. The density of freshwater is less dense than that of sea water. Aquatic organisms generally have streamlined body to help them move easily in water. Some organisms such as water lily has reduced cuticle that enable it to float at the surface of the water and it is also sensitive to changes in density. Eggs of aquatic organism sink to different depth. According to the density of the water because freshwater, sea water and brackish water bodies have different densities.</p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>TURBIDITY</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>Clean water has a very low turbidity while unclean water has high turbidity and turbidity is caused by the suspended matter in water. In low turbid water, light penetrate to a greater depth below water surface which enable photosynthetic organisms such as phyplankton (spirogyra) to manufacture its food.</p><br/>\r\n<p>In freshwater which is less dense, its turbidity increases during raining season as a result of debris is washed from the soil into the water bodies.</p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>CURRENT OR WATER FLOW</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>water current are mainly common in aquatic ecosystems. During raining season, fast current occur in river and stream but in ponds, lakes, sea etc water currents are mainly due to different in temperature between the upper and the lower part of a water body because the water body is not moving or flowing. Water current increase aeration (pores that allow oxygen to penetrate), increase the turbidity of water and carry warm water to colder regions which affect the distribution of aquatic organisms.</p><br/>\r\n<p>Water current affect most organisms found in an aquatic medium / habitat due to the speed of the water flow. For instance, animals living in fast moving water bodies have some structure for attaching themselves to the rocks or substratum so that they cannot be swept away.</p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>TIDAL MOVEMENT AND WAVES</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>They affect the Abiotic community dwelling in the intertidal zones of the seashore and river month. They exposed to tidal movements twice. Wave action is a result of various rate of air movement which affects most organisms living in the intertidal zones and seashores. Most of the organisms are attached to substratum for been swept away by waves or live in burrows. And some have hard body covering to prevent evaporation of water from their bodies. </p><br/>\r\n<p>Waves cause aeration of the surface waters in the open sea which enable aquatic organisms to have a enough supply of dissolved gases for their needs such as oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide (CO2), O2 for the aquatic animals and CO2 for the plants.<p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>DISSOLVED GASES</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>Both aquatic plants and animals need dissolve CO2 and O2 to carry out photosynthesis and cellular respiration respectively. O2 concentration decreases with increase in the depth of water i.e O2 is more abundant at the surface of the water. The presence of organic matter and high temperatures reduce the oxygen content of water. These factors affect organism dwelling in the aquatic medium, organism dwelling in the deep and bottom water bodies are specially adapted for living in water with low O2 concentration.</p>\r\n<h3><b>NATURE OF THE SUBSTRUM </b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>Sub-strum is the floor of the water bodies. It may be rocky or muddy which affect the kindâ€™s organisms. Generally, a muddy floor has a higher organic content from the sandy or the rocky types. As a result, more organisms live in a muddy substratum provided that O2 supply is sufficient. Burrow animals such as earthworms are usually found in swift-flowing streams and animals dwelling in such floors have structures that enable them to hold onto the rocky surface so as to prevent them from being swept away since it is a running water bodies.</p><br/>\r\n<h3><b>Step IV</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>The land is the major dwelling habitat of the biotic community and the main factors of terrestrial habitat are;</p><br/>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The land surface and the soil</li><br/>\r\n<li>Relative humidity</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3><b>LAND SURFACE</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>The land surface is responsible for variation in the vegetation of a place because it may be flat or sloping. For instance, a land in the tropic may have forest vegetation at its base and an acrospires vegetation near its peak. The slop may be steep  and its gradient affect the growth of organisms and its also encourage fast running water and therefore, encourages erosion which result in shallow and infertile soil which result to low yield of crops grown and few animals reared. But in gentle slopes, the flow of surface water is slow, erosion is minimized, and enough water is available to plants and animals which increase the biotic organisms present on such slopes.</p><br/><br/>\r\n<h3><b>SOIL </b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>Soil determines the vegetation of region. Regions with similar climates have variation in the type of plants due to soil differences. The types of soil are influenced by temperature and rainfall. Heavy rainfall causes leaching the washing away of soluble minerals to deep area that is out of reach of plant. And high temperature increases the rate of decomposition of organic matter into the soil, thereby lowering its humus contents. Hence, poor soil in the tropic is as a result of bad climatic condition and good soils in the temperature are as a result of good climatic condition.</p><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3><b>RELATIVE HUMIDITY</b></h3><br/>\r\n<p>It is the amount of moisture in the air. It is usually high in hot wet regions. It affects the rate of water vapour from the body surfaces of the organisms. A low humidity causes high water loss. Organisms living in a place of low humidity must possess a structure that reduces water loss. For instance, plants in the desert like cacti have reduced spines to prevent water los and camel mainly found in the desert conserve water in their bodies to prevent water loss.</p><br/>\r\n', '<ol>\r\n<li>Explain the following factors affecting an aquatic habitat in details. </li>\r\n<ul type=â€œletterâ€>\r\n<li>Rainfall</li>\r\n<li>Wind</li>\r\n<li>Turbidity</li>\r\n<li>Pressure</li></ul>\r\n<li>Write short note on the following.</li>\r\n<ul type=â€œletterâ€ >\r\n<li>Salinity</li>\r\n<li>Density</li>\r\n<li>Relative humidity</li>\r\n<li>Soil</li></ul>\r\n<li>Explain briefly on how important is temperature and rainfall to living organisms.</li>\r\n</ol><br/>\r\n', '', '<h3><b>SUMMARY</b></h3>\r\n<p>Abiotic factor are the non-living in the environment whole biotic are the living that interact with the Abiotic in their natural environment.
