(8, 'A fraction is a part of a complete or whole object. E.g. an orange sliced into two equal parts, one part is referred to as half of the orange ', 'Mathematics', 'FRACTIONS\r\nA fraction is a part of a complete or whole object. E.g. an orange sliced into two equal parts, one part is referred to as half of the orange expressed as  ½.\r\nAlso an orange could be sliced into three equal parts where one part is one-third, two is two-third.\r\nExpressed as 1/3 and 2/3\r\nFractions are divided into complex and simple fractions. i.e. ½, 1/3, 3/5, 2/5 etc as simple fractions and 10/5, 15/60, 25/100 etc\r\nIn other words the complex fractions could be reduced to their simplest forms.\r\nSimplifying a fraction\r\nMeans to reduce a fraction to its simplest form make it as simple as possible. For instance 4/8, 3/9.\r\n•	Get a whole orange slice it into 8 equal parts \r\n•	The first four forms a fraction of the 8 i.e. 4/8 (four –eight)\r\n•	Taking the four- eight and slicing them again into two you have another fraction of the remaining four i.e. 2/4 (two-fourth or two-quarter)\r\n•	Finally we could slice the two quarter into two and that gives us the final simplification where one part is a half of the other i.e. ½.\r\n\r\nRATIOS\r\nMeans for every amount of one thing, how much of another thin exists. For instance if one has 8 oranges and 6 mangoes in a bowl, the ratio of mangoes to oranges is 6:8 while the ratio of the orange to the mangoes is 8:6.\r\nRatio is expressed as 6 to 8 or 6:8\r\nRatios could also be converted into fractions\r\n8:6 = 8/6 simplified to 4/3\r\n6:8 = 6/8 simplified to ¾\r\nRatio could be used to share an object between group of persons. For instance, an amount of money can be shared between two brothers, so also jobs or food to avoid mis-understanding.\r\nExample\r\n•	If Ahmed is 15 years old and his younger brother 10 years old, the ratio of their age is 15:10 reduced/simplified to 3:2\r\nIf uncle Bala gives Ahmed and Abu 10 oranges, share the oranges between them using the ratio of their age.\r\n1st the sum of their age is 15 + 10 = 25 same as saying 3 +2 =5\r\nAhmed is 15 reduced to 3 while Abu is 10 reduced to 2\r\nAhmed will get 15/25 or 3/5 of the 10 while Abu gets 10/25 or 2/5 of the 10\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•	Divide the 10 oranges into 5 equal parts and label 3 parts of ech of the oranges A for Ahmed\r\n•	From the 10 oranges you discover Ahmed gets 30 pcs\r\n•	Arrange the 30 pcs to form whole oranges of 5 parts\r\n•	Now you have 6 whole oranges for ahmed\r\nSimilarly,\r\n•	you collect every other parts lablled B for Abu\r\n•	and from the 10 oranges Abu gets 20 pieces\r\n•	arrange the 20pcs to form whole oranges of 5 parts\r\n•	you discover Abu gets 4 whole oranges\r\n\r\n3/5 of 10  3/5 * 10 =6\r\n2/5 of 10  2/5 *10 = 4\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABILITY\r\nYou can’t predict the future but you can use mathematical probability to determine how likely it is that something will or will not take place\r\nThe study of probability helps to figure out the likelihood of something happening. For instance,when you roll a pair of dice, pick a card from a deck, the toss of coin at the start of a football game.\r\nSuppose we have a jar with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in it. Find the probability of picking a ball at random.\r\nYou should also know that at random all the balls have equal chances of being picked\r\nTherefore the possibility of picking a red ball is the ratio of the 4 red balls to the total number of balls in the jar which is 10\r\nSimilarly, Probability =       number of favorable outcomes\r\n		              -------------------------------------------------\r\n		               Total number of possible outcomes\r\n•	A favourable outcome is actually picking a ed ball	\r\n•	The total number of possible outcomes is a set called sample space which consist of all 10 balls in the jar\r\n\r\n\r\nSET THEORY\r\nLet’s start with a simple illustration of activities which take place at home. A mother who is suppose to go the market site down to analyze what the home needed, then she writes down; tomatoes, pepper, meat, oil, magi etc on a piece of paper. We call that purchase list, to avoid walking around the market. Then she will also arrange the items in an order depending on which store she is to enter first from the entrance to exit.\r\nIn mathematics, the purchase list is also called List, however, a set is even simpler; the order of the item is not important, and each kind of product is written once, one time in a set. For instance, a purchase list could be in this form [meat, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, salt] while a set is just similar, {meat, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, salt}.\r\nFor a set we use curly brackets, to stress that a set is not a list. Because the order of the items is not important in a set, all set with other orders yet same items are the same;\r\n {meat, fish, pepper, salt, tomatoes} = {tomatoes, meat, pepper, salt, fish}\r\nWhat is called an item in a list is called an element in a set. To save writing and make reading easier we use small letters for the elements of a set. Large letters (capital) for the sets i.e. A = {m, f, p, t, s}\r\nThe symbol = means whenever we want to use A in a calculation we can also use {m, f, p, t, s}. \r\nA set theory therefore could be defined \r\n•	As a set of elements, all the elements of a set are written between curly brackets.\r\n•	Each element is different from all other elements in a set.\r\n•	The order of the elements does not matter\r\n', '1387796412.jpg', 1),

First, copy the speaker illustration \r\ncreated in the previous tutorial and place it in the middle of your artboard. \r\nNext, grab the Rectangle Tool(M), create a shape the size of your artboard and \r\nSend it to Back (Shift + Control + [ ). Fill it with R=45 G=45 B=45 then open \r\nthe fly-out menu of the Appearance panel and click on Add New Fill. This will \r\nadd a second fill for your shape. Select it from the Appearance, make it black, \r\nlower its opacity to 20%, change the blending mode to Multiply then go to Effect \r\n&gt; Artistic &gt; Film Grain. Enter the data shown below, click OK then add a \r\nthird fill for this shape. You will need a nice pattern for this new fill. Open \r\nthe fly-out menu of the Swatches panel and go to Open Swatch Library &gt; \r\nPattern &gt; Basic Graphics &gt; Basic Graphics_Textures. Reselect the third \r\nfill, lower its opacity to 25%, change the blending mode to Overlay then use the \r\nUSGS 20 Scrub pattern. In the end your shape should look like in the following \r\nimage. Lock it to make sure that you won''t accidentally select/move it.</P>\r\n<P><A href="Create%20a%20Poster%20Theme%20Illustration%20in%20Illustrator_files/techno01.jpg"><IMG \r\nwidth="600" title="step1" alt="step1" src="Create%20a%20Poster%20Theme%20Illustration%20in%20Illustrator_files/techno01.jpg"></A></P>\r\n<H3>Step 2</H3>\r\n<P>Select the speaker shape and make a copy in front (Control + C &gt; Control + \r\nF).

Now, let’s focus \r\non this fresh shape. First, remove the Outer Glow effect then replace the \r\nexisting fill color with the radial gradient shown below image #4. The yellow \r\nnumber from the gradient image stands for opacity percentage. Next, lower its \r\nopacity to 50% and change the blending mode to Overlay then go to Effect &gt; \r\nBlur &gt; Gaussian Blur. Enter a 10px radius then click OK.</P>\r\n', 0),

(8, 'A fraction is a part of a complete or whole object. E.g. an orange sliced into two equal parts, one part is referred to as half of the orange ', 'Mathematics', 'FRACTIONS\r\nA fraction is a part of a complete or whole object. E.g. an orange sliced into two equal parts, one part is referred to as half of the orange expressed as  ½.\r\nAlso an orange could be sliced into three equal parts where one part is one-third, two is two-third.\r\nExpressed as 1/3 and 2/3\r\nFractions are divided into complex and simple fractions. i.e. ½, 1/3, 3/5, 2/5 etc as simple fractions and 10/5, 15/60, 25/100 etc\r\nIn other words the complex fractions could be reduced to their simplest forms.\r\nSimplifying a fraction\r\nMeans to reduce a fraction to its simplest form make it as simple as possible. For instance 4/8, 3/9.\r\n•	Get a whole orange slice it into 8 equal parts \r\n•	The first four forms a fraction of the 8 i.e. 4/8 (four –eight)\r\n•	Taking the four- eight and slicing them again into two you have another fraction of the remaining four i.e. 2/4 (two-fourth or two-quarter)\r\n•	Finally we could slice the two quarter into two and that gives us the final simplification where one part is a half of the other i.e. ½.\r\n\r\nRATIOS\r\nMeans for every amount of one thing, how much of another thin exists. For instance if one has 8 oranges and 6 mangoes in a bowl, the ratio of mangoes to oranges is 6:8 while the ratio of the orange to the mangoes is 8:6.\r\nRatio is expressed as 6 to 8 or 6:8\r\nRatios could also be converted into fractions\r\n8:6 = 8/6 simplified to 4/3\r\n6:8 = 6/8 simplified to ¾\r\nRatio could be used to share an object between group of persons. For instance, an amount of money can be shared between two brothers, so also jobs or food to avoid mis-understanding.\r\nExample\r\n•	If Ahmed is 15 years old and his younger brother 10 years old, the ratio of their age is 15:10 reduced/simplified to 3:2\r\nIf uncle Bala gives Ahmed and Abu 10 oranges, share the oranges between them using the ratio of their age.\r\n1st the sum of their age is 15 + 10 = 25 same as saying 3 +2 =5\r\nAhmed is 15 reduced to 3 while Abu is 10 reduced to 2\r\nAhmed will get 15/25 or 3/5 of the 10 while Abu gets 10/25 or 2/5 of the 10\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•	Divide the 10 oranges into 5 equal parts and label 3 parts of ech of the oranges A for Ahmed\r\n•	From the 10 oranges you discover Ahmed gets 30 pcs\r\n•	Arrange the 30 pcs to form whole oranges of 5 parts\r\n•	Now you have 6 whole oranges for ahmed\r\nSimilarly,\r\n•	you collect every other parts lablled B for Abu\r\n•	and from the 10 oranges Abu gets 20 pieces\r\n•	arrange the 20pcs to form whole oranges of 5 parts\r\n•	you discover Abu gets 4 whole oranges\r\n\r\n3/5 of 10  3/5 * 10 =6\r\n2/5 of 10  2/5 *10 = 4\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABILITY\r\nYou can’t predict the future but you can use mathematical probability to determine how likely it is that something will or will not take place\r\nThe study of probability helps to figure out the likelihood of something happening. For instance,when you roll a pair of dice, pick a card from a deck, the toss of coin at the start of a football game.\r\nSuppose we have a jar with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in it. Find the probability of picking a ball at random.\r\nYou should also know that at random all the balls have equal chances of being picked\r\nTherefore the possibility of picking a red ball is the ratio of the 4 red balls to the total number of balls in the jar which is 10\r\nSimilarly, Probability =       number of favorable outcomes\r\n		              -------------------------------------------------\r\n		               Total number of possible outcomes\r\n•	A favourable outcome is actually picking a ed ball	\r\n•	The total number of possible outcomes is a set called sample space which consist of all 10 balls in the jar\r\n\r\n\r\nSET THEORY\r\nLet’s start with a simple illustration of activities which take place at home. A mother who is suppose to go the market site down to analyze what the home needed, then she writes down; tomatoes, pepper, meat, oil, magi etc on a piece of paper. We call that purchase list, to avoid walking around the market. Then she will also arrange the items in an order depending on which store she is to enter first from the entrance to exit.\r\nIn mathematics, the purchase list is also called List, however, a set is even simpler; the order of the item is not important, and each kind of product is written once, one time in a set. For instance, a purchase list could be in this form [meat, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, salt] while a set is just similar, {meat, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, salt}.\r\nFor a set we use curly brackets, to stress that a set is not a list. Because the order of the items is not important in a set, all set with other orders yet same items are the same;\r\n {meat, fish, pepper, salt, tomatoes} = {tomatoes, meat, pepper, salt, fish}\r\nWhat is called an item in a list is called an element in a set. To save writing and make reading easier we use small letters for the elements of a set. Large letters (capital) for the sets i.e. A = {m, f, p, t, s}\r\nThe symbol = means whenever we want to use A in a calculation we can also use {m, f, p, t, s}. \r\nA set theory therefore could be defined \r\n•	As a set of elements, all the elements of a set are written between curly brackets.\r\n•	Each element is different from all other elements in a set.\r\n•	The order of the elements does not matter\r\n', '1387796412.jpg', 1),

(8, 'A fraction is a part of a complete or whole object. E.g. an orange sliced into two equal parts, one part is referred to as half of the orange ', 'Mathematics', 'FRACTIONS\r\nA fraction is a part of a complete or whole object. E.g. an orange sliced into two equal parts, one part is referred to as half of the orange expressed as  ½.\r\nAlso an orange could be sliced into three equal parts where one part is one-third, two is two-third.\r\nExpressed as 1/3 and 2/3\r\nFractions are divided into complex and simple fractions. i.e. ½, 1/3, 3/5, 2/5 etc as simple fractions and 10/5, 15/60, 25/100 etc\r\nIn other words the complex fractions could be reduced to their simplest forms.\r\nSimplifying a fraction\r\nMeans to reduce a fraction to its simplest form make it as simple as possible. For instance 4/8, 3/9.\r\n•	Get a whole orange slice it into 8 equal parts \r\n•	The first four forms a fraction of the 8 i.e. 4/8 (four –eight)\r\n•	Taking the four- eight and slicing them again into two you have another fraction of the remaining four i.e. 2/4 (two-fourth or two-quarter)\r\n•	Finally we could slice the two quarter into two and that gives us the final simplification where one part is a half of the other i.e. ½.\r\n\r\nRATIOS\r\nMeans for every amount of one thing, how much of another thin exists. For instance if one has 8 oranges and 6 mangoes in a bowl, the ratio of mangoes to oranges is 6:8 while the ratio of the orange to the mangoes is 8:6.\r\nRatio is expressed as 6 to 8 or 6:8\r\nRatios could also be converted into fractions\r\n8:6 = 8/6 simplified to 4/3\r\n6:8 = 6/8 simplified to ¾\r\nRatio could be used to share an object between group of persons. For instance, an amount of money can be shared between two brothers, so also jobs or food to avoid mis-understanding.\r\nExample\r\n•	If Ahmed is 15 years old and his younger brother 10 years old, the ratio of their age is 15:10 reduced/simplified to 3:2\r\nIf uncle Bala gives Ahmed and Abu 10 oranges, share the oranges between them using the ratio of their age.\r\n1st the sum of their age is 15 + 10 = 25 same as saying 3 +2 =5\r\nAhmed is 15 reduced to 3 while Abu is 10 reduced to 2\r\nAhmed will get 15/25 or 3/5 of the 10 while Abu gets 10/25 or 2/5 of the 10\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n•	Divide the 10 oranges into 5 equal parts and label 3 parts of ech of the oranges A for Ahmed\r\n•	From the 10 oranges you discover Ahmed gets 30 pcs\r\n•	Arrange the 30 pcs to form whole oranges of 5 parts\r\n•	Now you have 6 whole oranges for ahmed\r\nSimilarly,\r\n•	you collect every other parts lablled B for Abu\r\n•	and from the 10 oranges Abu gets 20 pieces\r\n•	arrange the 20pcs to form whole oranges of 5 parts\r\n•	you discover Abu gets 4 whole oranges\r\n\r\n3/5 of 10  3/5 * 10 =6\r\n2/5 of 10  2/5 *10 = 4\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBABILITY\r\nYou can’t predict the future but you can use mathematical probability to determine how likely it is that something will or will not take place\r\nThe study of probability helps to figure out the likelihood of something happening. For instance,when you roll a pair of dice, pick a card from a deck, the toss of coin at the start of a football game.\r\nSuppose we have a jar with 4 red balls and 6 blue balls in it. Find the probability of picking a ball at random.\r\nYou should also know that at random all the balls have equal chances of being picked\r\nTherefore the possibility of picking a red ball is the ratio of the 4 red balls to the total number of balls in the jar which is 10\r\nSimilarly, Probability =       number of favorable outcomes\r\n		              -------------------------------------------------\r\n		               Total number of possible outcomes\r\n•	A favourable outcome is actually picking a ed ball	\r\n•	The total number of possible outcomes is a set called sample space which consist of all 10 balls in the jar\r\n\r\n\r\nSET THEORY\r\nLet’s start with a simple illustration of activities which take place at home. A mother who is suppose to go the market site down to analyze what the home needed, then she writes down; tomatoes, pepper, meat, oil, magi etc on a piece of paper. We call that purchase list, to avoid walking around the market. Then she will also arrange the items in an order depending on which store she is to enter first from the entrance to exit.\r\nIn mathematics, the purchase list is also called List, however, a set is even simpler; the order of the item is not important, and each kind of product is written once, one time in a set. For instance, a purchase list could be in this form [meat, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, salt] while a set is just similar, {meat, fish, pepper, tomatoes, onions, salt}.\r\nFor a set we use curly brackets, to stress that a set is not a list. Because the order of the items is not important in a set, all set with other orders yet same items are the same;\r\n {meat, fish, pepper, salt, tomatoes} = {tomatoes, meat, pepper, salt, fish}\r\nWhat is called an item in a list is called an element in a set. To save writing and make reading easier we use small letters for the elements of a set. Large letters (capital) for the sets i.e. A = {m, f, p, t, s}\r\nThe symbol = means whenever we want to use A in a calculation we can also use {m, f, p, t, s}. \r\nA set theory therefore could be defined \r\n•	As a set of elements, all the elements of a set are written between curly brackets.\r\n•	Each element is different from all other elements in a set.\r\n•	The order of the elements does not matter\r\n', '1387796412.jpg', 1, '0000-00-00'),
